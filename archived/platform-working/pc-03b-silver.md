# Data Plane Layer — Silver (Processed)

## Purpose
The Silver layer is the **standardization stage** of the Data Plane.  
It transforms raw, immutable Bronze data into structured, business-ready datasets by cleaning, deduplicating, and aligning it with organizational keys.  
Silver ensures that downstream GDP and KPI layers operate on a consistent and reliable foundation.

## Responsibilities
- **Cleaning** — remove duplicates, handle nulls, and apply baseline data quality rules.  
- **Standardization** — normalize formats (dates, currencies, codes) across heterogeneous sources.  
- **Key alignment** — map operational IDs into standardized business keys (e.g., customer, product, account).  
- **Reference data integration** — apply calendars, FX rates, and organizational hierarchies defined in governance.  
- **Audit traceability** — maintain links back to Bronze records for full lineage.

## Non-Goals
- No KPI computation — KPIs are derived only in the Gold/KPI layers.  
- No tenant overlays or extensions — those are resolved later at the GDP layer.  
- No governance approvals — Silver transformations are driven by contracts authored in the Control Plane.  

## Flows
1. **Ingest** — Bronze data enters Silver processing pipelines.  
2. **Clean** — duplicates removed, missing values handled, formats standardized.  
3. **Align** — map operational IDs into conformed business keys.  
4. **Integrate** — join reference datasets (e.g., fiscal calendars, FX rates, hierarchies).  
5. **Publish** — standardized datasets stored in Silver, with lineage pointers to Bronze.  

## Why This Matters
Without the Silver layer, every downstream metric would inherit inconsistencies from raw sources.  
By enforcing structure and consistency here:
- **Engineers** work with predictable, clean inputs.  
- **Executives** receive KPIs built on comparable, standardized data.  
- **Auditors** can trace every GDP or KPI back to a well-defined, governed transformation from Bronze.  

The Silver layer ensures the platform is **consistent, comparable, and audit-ready**.
