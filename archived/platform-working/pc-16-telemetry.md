# Platform Runtime Foundations — Telemetry Pipeline

## Purpose
The Telemetry Pipeline provides **observability** across the entire platform.  
It collects metrics, logs, and traces from both Control Plane and Data Plane services, ensuring operators, executives, and auditors can monitor system health without needing direct access to tenant data.  
Telemetry is the nervous system of the platform, turning raw events into meaningful signals.

## Responsibilities
- **Metrics collection** — capture system performance, job runtimes, error rates, and throughput.  
- **Logging** — store structured logs with correlation IDs linking back to orchestration runs and tenant contexts.  
- **Tracing** — follow requests end-to-end across Control and Data planes for root cause analysis.  
- **Retention classes** — enforce short-term, medium-term, and long-term retention policies aligned to compliance.  
- **Aggregation & filtering** — control cardinality and sampling to ensure performance without losing critical signals.  
- **Dashboards** — feed governance-facing health views in Host App and operational dashboards for platform teams.  

## Non-Goals
- Does not compute KPIs or tenant-facing metrics (KPI Layer + Tenant App handle that).  
- Does not replace audit evidence (Audit & Evidence logs serve compliance needs).  
- Does not enforce governance approvals (Host App scope).  

## Flows
1. **Emit** — platform services (orchestration, tenant app, data plane jobs) emit metrics, logs, and traces.  
2. **Ingest** — telemetry pipeline collects signals in standardized formats with correlation IDs.  
3. **Process** — signals are aggregated, filtered, and enriched with metadata (tenant, run ID, severity).  
4. **Store** — telemetry stored in retention classes: short (real-time ops), medium (diagnostics), long (compliance evidence).  
5. **Visualize** — dashboards and alerts surface key signals to operators and governance stakeholders.  

## Interfaces
- **Orchestration & Scheduling** — emits job run metrics and error signals.  
- **Tenant App** — emits usage events, quota checks, and request traces.  
- **Host App** — consumes aggregated telemetry for read-only governance dashboards.  
- **Alerts & Monitoring** — subscribes to telemetry signals to trigger notifications.  
- **Lineage & Metadata** — links telemetry signals to contract and run lineage.  

## Why This Matters
Without telemetry, the platform is a black box — operators can’t act proactively, executives can’t measure service health, and auditors can’t prove observability controls.  
By embedding a telemetry pipeline:
- **Engineers** can diagnose and resolve issues quickly.  
- **Executives** gain visibility into SLA adherence and platform reliability.  
- **Auditors** receive evidence that observability requirements are continuously enforced.  

The Telemetry Pipeline ensures the platform is **observable, measurable, and accountable**.
