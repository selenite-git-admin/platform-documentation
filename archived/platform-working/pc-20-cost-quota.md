# Platform Runtime Foundations — Cost & Quota Enforcement

## Purpose
The Cost & Quota Enforcement service ensures **fair resource usage and financial transparency** across tenants.  
It applies quotas to compute, storage, and data movement, preventing noisy-neighbor effects, while generating usage metrics for showback or chargeback reporting.  
This protects the platform’s sustainability and ensures tenant workloads remain predictable.

## Responsibilities
- **Quota enforcement** — apply per-tenant limits on compute, storage, and API calls.  
- **Throttling** — dynamically limit workloads that exceed defined thresholds.  
- **Usage metering** — capture fine-grained metrics on platform resource consumption.  
- **Cost attribution** — tag workloads and storage for tenant-level cost tracking.  
- **Governance integration** — align quotas with Host App policies and contractual commitments.  

## Non-Goals
- Not responsible for billing or invoicing (finance systems consume usage reports).  
- Does not enforce residency or compliance rules (covered in Residency & Compliance).  
- Not a replacement for Security & RBAC controls.  

## Flows
1. **Define** — Host App sets quota and cost policies at tenant onboarding or contract renewal.  
2. **Enforce** — runtime services apply quotas during orchestration and job execution.  
3. **Throttle** — workloads breaching thresholds are slowed or suspended safely.  
4. **Measure** — telemetry captures usage metrics tagged by tenant, dataset, and workload.  
5. **Report** — Host App exposes quota status and usage summaries for governance and tenants.  

## Interfaces
- **Host App** — defines governance-level quotas and contractual policies.  
- **Orchestration & Scheduling** — enforces compute and execution quotas in real time.  
- **Telemetry Pipeline** — collects detailed usage metrics.  
- **Tenant App** — displays quota usage to tenant admins for transparency.  
- **Audit & Evidence** — records quota enforcement actions and cost attribution logs.  

## Why This Matters
Without quotas, some tenants could monopolize resources, degrade performance, or create unexpected costs.  
By embedding cost and quota enforcement:
- **Executives** ensure platform sustainability and cost transparency.  
- **Tenants** see predictable performance and visibility into their resource consumption.  
- **Auditors** gain evidence that quotas and usage limits are actively enforced.  

The Cost & Quota Enforcement service ensures the platform is **fair, sustainable, and transparent**.
