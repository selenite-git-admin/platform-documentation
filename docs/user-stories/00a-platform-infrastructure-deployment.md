# Platform Infrastructure Deployment

> Goal: Deploy the core platform infrastructure so that tenants can be provisioned securely and consistently.  
> Scope: Covers base infrastructure setup including control plane, data plane, and shared services.

## Context
The platform needs a consistent and secure foundation before tenant onboarding begins.  
This story focuses on deploying the base infrastructure components such as control plane services, data plane clusters, and shared services like secrets management.  
The deployment must align with security, scalability, and compliance requirements.

## Actors (Personas and Roles)
- Platform Owner: approves infrastructure provisioning  
- Platform Admin: executes infrastructure deployment steps  
- Security Admin: validates identity, network, and secrets setup  
- Observability Engineer: ensures monitoring and logging are enabled

## Preconditions
- Infrastructure as code templates are ready  
- Secrets management system available  
- IAM roles defined  
- Network and VPC configuration approved

## Scenario Flow
1. Platform Admin triggers deployment using approved templates  
2. Control plane services are provisioned in the designated cloud environment  
3. Data plane clusters created and linked to control plane  
4. Shared services such as secrets, logging, and monitoring deployed  
5. Security Admin validates IAM and network configuration  
6. Observability dashboards enabled for monitoring platform health

## Acceptance Criteria
- Control plane, data plane, and shared services deployed successfully  
- IAM and network configurations validated  
- Monitoring and logging enabled  
- Infrastructure receipts available for audit

## Failure Paths
- Deployment template error: job fails, error logged  
- IAM misconfiguration: security validation fails, deployment rolled back  
- Missing dependencies: shared services not provisioned, alert raised

## Observability and Governance
- Audit Events: infra.deployed, infra.validated  
- Metrics: deployment_success_rate, rollback_count  
- RBAC: only Platform Admin can execute deployment  
- Evidence: receipts stored for compliance

## Configuration Examples

**Deployment Receipt (YAML)**
```yaml
deployment_id: DEP-001
control_plane: provisioned
data_plane: provisioned
shared_services: provisioned
validated_by: security_admin@platform.com
status: SUCCESS
```

## BDD Scenarios

### Scenario: Successful infrastructure deployment
```gherkin
Given Platform Admin has valid templates
When deployment is triggered
Then control plane and data plane are provisioned
And receipts confirm success
```

### Scenario: Deployment blocked due to IAM misconfiguration
```gherkin
Given Platform Admin triggers deployment
When IAM configuration fails validation
Then deployment is rolled back
And error is logged
```

## Review Checklist
- [x] Templates validated  
- [x] Control plane and data plane provisioned  
- [x] Shared services active  
- [x] IAM and network validated  
- [x] Monitoring enabled
