# Hybrid Deployment

> Goal: Support hybrid deployments across cloud and on premises environments.  
> Scope: Covers deployment, connectivity, synchronization, and governance.

## Context
Many enterprises use a hybrid environment with both cloud and on premises systems. The platform must support secure deployment and consistent governance across both.

## Actors (Personas and Roles)
- Platform Admin: deploys and manages hybrid environments
- Security Admin: configures connectivity and encryption
- Compliance Officer: validates governance across environments

## Preconditions
- Hybrid deployment strategy approved
- Connectivity established between cloud and on premises
- Security controls implemented

## Scenario Flow
1. Platform Admin initiates hybrid deployment
2. Security Admin configures secure connectivity and encryption
3. Synchronization enabled between cloud and on premises stores
4. Compliance Officer validates governance
5. Deployment receipts recorded

## Acceptance Criteria
- Hybrid deployment executed successfully
- Secure connectivity verified
- Governance validated

## Failure Paths
- Connectivity error: retry or escalate
- Encryption misconfiguration: block deployment
- Governance failure: deployment halted

## Observability and Governance
- Audit Events: hybrid.deployment.started, hybrid.deployment.completed
- Metrics: hybrid_deploy_success_rate, sync_latency
- Evidence: deployment receipts and compliance logs

## Configuration Examples

**Hybrid Deployment Config (JSON)**
```json
{
  "deployment_id": "DEP-2025-09-29-001",
  "mode": "hybrid",
  "cloud_region": "ap-south-1",
  "on_prem": "datacenter-1",
  "status": "completed"
}
```

## BDD Scenarios

### Scenario: Hybrid deployment completed successfully
```gherkin
Given a hybrid deployment strategy is approved
When Platform Admin initiates deployment
Then the system deploys across environments
And governance is validated
```

### Scenario: Hybrid deployment blocked by encryption misconfiguration
```gherkin
Given a hybrid deployment is in progress
When encryption is misconfigured
Then the deployment is blocked
And an alert is raised
```

## Review Checklist
- [x] Hybrid deployment executed
- [x] Connectivity secure
- [x] Governance validated
