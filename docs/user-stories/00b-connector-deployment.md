# Connector Deployment and Maintenance

> Goal: Deploy and maintain data connectors that enable ingestion from enterprise systems.  
> Scope: Covers connector installation, configuration, validation, and ongoing updates.

## Context
Connectors are the bridge between tenant systems and the platform.  
They must be deployed securely, validated before use, and maintained over time to handle schema changes or upgrades.  
This story ensures reliable and auditable connector lifecycle management.

## Actors (Personas and Roles)
- Platform Admin: deploys and configures connectors  
- Tenant Data Engineer: provides tenant-specific connection details  
- Security Admin: validates secrets and access policies  
- Observability Engineer: monitors connector performance

## Preconditions
- Infrastructure deployed and active  
- Connector templates available  
- Secrets provisioned securely  
- Network access between tenant system and platform verified

## Scenario Flow
1. Platform Admin selects connector template and initiates deployment  
2. Tenant Data Engineer supplies credentials and endpoint configuration  
3. Connector deployed and preflight validation performed  
4. Security Admin validates secret storage and access scope  
5. Connector marked active and available for data onboarding  
6. Maintenance: updates and schema adjustments applied periodically

## Acceptance Criteria
- Connector deployed successfully with secure configuration  
- Preflight validation passed  
- Secrets stored securely  
- Monitoring active for connector health

## Failure Paths
- Invalid tenant credentials: connector fails preflight validation  
- Network error: connection attempt fails, alert raised  
- Schema drift: maintenance update required, incident ticket generated

## Observability and Governance
- Audit Events: connector.deployed, connector.validated, connector.updated  
- Metrics: connector_uptime, validation_success_rate  
- RBAC: deployment limited to Platform Admin, configuration inputs restricted to Tenant Data Engineer  
- Evidence: deployment receipts and validation logs

## Configuration Examples

**Connector Deployment Receipt (JSON)**
```json
{
  "connector": "CRM",
  "status": "ACTIVE",
  "validated": true,
  "validated_by": "security_admin@platform.com",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-29T10:00:00Z"
}
```

## BDD Scenarios

### Scenario: Successful connector deployment
```gherkin
Given Platform Admin selects a connector template
And Tenant Data Engineer provides valid credentials
When the connector is deployed
Then the connector passes preflight validation
And status is set to ACTIVE
```

### Scenario: Connector deployment fails due to invalid credentials
```gherkin
Given Tenant Data Engineer provides invalid credentials
When the connector preflight runs
Then validation fails
And an error is logged
```
