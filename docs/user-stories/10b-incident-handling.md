# Incident Handling

> Goal: Detect, triage, and resolve operational incidents.  
> Scope: Covers incident classification, response workflow, communication, and postmortem.

## Context
Incidents disrupt platform reliability or data integrity. A consistent response workflow limits impact and improves recovery time.

## Actors (Personas and Roles)
- Platform Admin: incident commander for operations
- Observability Engineer: supplies evidence and context
- Security Admin: handles security incidents
- Compliance Officer: tracks evidence for regulated events

## Preconditions
- Monitoring and alerting active
- Incident response playbooks available
- Communication channels configured

## Scenario Flow
1. Alert triggers an incident and assigns an incident commander
2. Triage classifies severity and impact
3. Mitigation steps executed and progress communicated
4. Resolution verified and incident closed
5. Postmortem created with corrective actions

## Acceptance Criteria
- Incident tracked from detection to closure
- Communication log maintained
- Postmortem completed with action items

## Failure Paths
- Escalation failure: no responder acknowledges
- Incomplete mitigation: issue recurs
- Missing postmortem: learning lost

## Observability and Governance
- Audit Events: incident.opened, incident.updated, incident.closed
- Metrics: mttr_minutes, reopen_rate, postmortem_completion_rate
- Evidence: incident timeline and artifacts

## Configuration Examples

**Incident Record (YAML)**
```yaml
incident_id: INC-2025-09-29-001
severity: SEV2
service: connector:CRM
status: closed
mttr_minutes: 42
```

## BDD Scenarios

### Scenario: Incident resolved within target MTTR
```gherkin
Given an incident is opened
When mitigation is applied
Then the incident is resolved within the MTTR target
And a postmortem is created
```

### Scenario: Incident reopens due to incomplete mitigation
```gherkin
Given an incident is closed
When the issue recurs
Then the incident is reopened
And additional corrective actions are added
```

## Review Checklist
- [x] Incident commander assigned
- [x] Communication log maintained
- [x] Postmortem completed
