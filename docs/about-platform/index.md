# BareCount™ - Data Action Platform  

Enterprises run on systems of records.
ERP, CRM, HR, and manufacturing systems capture every transaction. 
They are precise within their scope and enforce compliance with statutory and operational rules.
Their job is to log and safeguard business events as they happen.

The limitation is fragmentation. Each system speaks its own language.
Finance knows invoices, sales know opportunities, operations know batches, but they do not align naturally. 
When leadership asks a cross-functional question, different teams bring different numbers.
Time is lost reconciling, and confidence erodes.

The BareCount™ data action platform builds on top of those systems of record.
Where the record systems ensure data exists and is correct locally,
the platform ensures data is consistent, explainable, and actionable across the enterprise.
It acts as the system of action:
refining what records produce, unifying it through contracts, and activating outcomes through governed workflows.
KPIs are not static reports here; they are living metrics tied to evidence and directly linked to next steps.

## Understanding the Platform   

This documentation explains the foundation BareCount™ provides to address enterprise data issues.
How it removes engineering overhead, introduces contracts for numbers, embeds business context from the start, and connects data directly to actions.
The result is consistent, auditable, and actionable numbers that strengthen the systems enterprises already use.

- **Problem**  
  Enterprises face data drag: long lead times, inconsistent reports, and low impact despite high spend.  
  [Read more](01-problem.md)

- **Root Causes**  
  The issues are structural: engineering-heavy pipelines, absence of data contracts, missing business context, and a consumption model that stops at dashboards.  
  [Read more](02-root-causes.md)

- **Solution**  
  A contract-first approach that layers Golden Data Points and KPIs over raw sources, governed from request to delivery so outputs are reusable and auditable.  
  [Read more](03-solution.md)

- **Modules**  
  The platform is organized into clear modules: Host, Compute, Data Storage, Consumption, Action, Application, Security, Access, Trust, Runtime, and Data Utilities.  
  Each domain defines its boundaries and lists modules that implement its responsibilities.

- **Working**  
  End-to-end flow that starts with approval at Host, moves through ingestion and normalization, constructs KPIs, publishes governed products, and activates actions in external systems, with cross-cutting domains at every step.

- **Offerings**  
  Modular executive packs such as CFO and CGO, plus value packs for compliance, analytics, and BI acceleration.

- **Deployment**  
  Flexible options: cloud multi-tenant, dedicated single-tenant, or on-premise hybrid, adopted without disrupting existing systems.

Together these pages show how the BareCount™ Data Action Platform governs data from first touch to final action so results are dependable, versioned, and auditable.
