# Root Causes of the D&A Drag  

Investments in tools, platforms, and teams are not the real bottleneck. The drag persists because the way enterprises handle data has structural gaps. These root causes explain why traditional approaches fail to deliver and why a new foundation is required.  

## Engineering Overload  
Enterprises depend on engineering-heavy projects to move data from systems into usable form.  
- Pipelines, reconciliations, and custom builds consume scarce technical talent.  
- Every new KPI or requirement means another iteration of code or modeling.  
- Spreadsheets remain the fallback when deadlines are tight.  

This cycle slows delivery and increases cost. It locks insights behind engineering queues, creating dependency and frustration across business teams.  

## Lack of Contracts  
Unlike other enterprise functions, data has no contractual guarantees.  
- Numbers are generated without consistent records of origin or logic.  
- Definitions vary across departments, leading to constant reconciliation debates.  
- Validation is ad hoc, with little transparency into quality checks.  

Without governance at the number level, trust erodes. Executives cannot act decisively when they must first question the numbers themselves.  

## Missing Business Context  
Data platforms often surface raw tables or generic metrics.  
- Finance, Sales, and Operations teams still need to remodel them into usable KPIs.  
- Each function defines numbers differently, creating silos and inconsistencies.  
- Adoption slows because business users do not see their reality reflected out of the box.  

This absence of embedded context makes data look powerful on paper but weak in practice.  

## Passive Consumption  
Dashboards and reports are designed to describe the past.  
- They present information but stop short of guiding action.  
- Numbers remain static, with no connection to workflows or accountability loops.  
- Decision-makers are left with hindsight views, acting after the fact.  

Data becomes a reference layer instead of an active driver of outcomes.

These four root causes reinforce each other, keeping data trapped in a cycle of low trust, high effort, and delayed impact. Addressing them requires a platform that removes engineering overhead, brings contracts to numbers, delivers built-in business context, and connects data directly to action.
