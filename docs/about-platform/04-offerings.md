# Offerings

BareCount™ is delivered through modular **Executive Packs**.
Each pack is built on the platform’s contract-bound foundation, ensuring trust and auditability across all functions.
The design allows enterprises to adopt incrementally while achieving the shortest possible time to value.

## Flexible Adoption Paths

Organizations can begin in different ways:

- Start with a single function to address an immediate pain point.
- Expand across multiple domains to achieve enterprise-wide alignment.
- Go deeper within a function to unlock advanced KPIs, anomaly detection, and compliance use cases.

Each pack includes:

- **Pre-defined KPIs** mapped to the platform foundation.
- **Contracts** that capture origin, calculation logic, and validation rules.
- **Action Panel templates** for workflows, anomaly detection, and quality checks.

This approach accelerates reporting and decision processes without requiring large data engineering projects.
