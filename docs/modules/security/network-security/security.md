# Network Security – Security

## Scope
Security posture for network security operations.

## Data Protection
- TLS 1.3, HSTS, modern ciphers; secure cookie flags.

## Access Control
- Least privilege; per‑path policies; per‑tenant rate limits.

## Auditability
- Log all admin changes with actor, reason, and evidence ids.

## Notes
- No public subnets for tenant workloads
- All egress requires explicit allow‑list
- Provisioning must be declarative and reviewed
