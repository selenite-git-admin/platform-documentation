# Anomaly Detection Module — Overview

Audience: Platform engineers, solution architects, tenant administrators, and business data analysts  
Status: Version 1.0 (Rule-Based Engine Active; ML Engine Deferred)  
Purpose: Define the rationale, scope, and operational boundaries of the Anomaly Detection Module as a tenant-level feature integrated within the business data stack. The module adds continuous intelligence to detect financial and operational irregularities embedded in each tenant’s golden data and KPI layers.

---

## Context and Motivation

Tenants generate large volumes of structured business data through daily operations: invoices, payments, orders, production runs, campaigns, and transactions. These datasets form the input for analytics, forecasting, and executive reporting.  
Yet even within curated pipelines, unexpected deviations occur: sales drop-offs, cost surges, data entry inconsistencies, margin distortions, or missing transactions. Traditional BI dashboards only reveal such anomalies retrospectively, once losses are visible in KPIs.  

The Anomaly Detection Module introduces proactive, tenant-scoped surveillance across data layers. It continuously scans golden data points (GDPs) and computed KPIs to identify outliers, missing patterns, or unexpected shifts. The goal is not only to detect data quality issues but to surface genuine *business sense deviations* before they cascade into decision errors.

This capability directly supports the platform’s promise of **trustworthy, intelligent, self-observing data infrastructure**.

---

## Role within the Platform

The module sits within the **tenant intelligence layer**, adjacent to the KPI computation and reporting pipeline. It operates after GDP aggregation and before insights publication.  
It consumes standardized, human-readable datasets and returns anomaly events back into the tenant’s control plane.

Integration path:
1. Pipelines publish GDP and KPI tables into tenant marts.  
2. The anomaly controller subscribes to data change events.  
3. Each active rule set for that tenant is evaluated against the latest metrics.  
4. Detected anomalies are stored, routed, and optionally trigger downstream actions (alert, pause workflow, audit ticket).  

Through this approach, anomaly detection becomes an intrinsic part of every tenant’s analytical life cycle rather than an external diagnostic process.

---

## Design Philosophy

### Tenant-Scoped Operation
Every tenant maintains a dedicated anomaly workspace, registry, and storage policy. No cross-tenant computation or mixed baselines are permitted. All baselines and thresholds derive strictly from that tenant’s own history.

### Business-Semantic Evaluation
Detection occurs at the same semantic layer as KPIs. Each anomaly is explainable in business language: *“Average realization per order decreased by 12 percent compared with previous quarter median.”*  
This prevents technical noise from clouding business interpretations.

### Rule-Based Core, ML-Ready Structure
The initial release implements deterministic rule evaluation with explicit conditions, thresholds, and baselines.  
Later releases will allow ML-driven scoring without altering schema or APIs, ensuring continuity of integration.

### Declarative Configuration
Tenants declare their own detection rules via configuration manifests or API definitions. Each rule is versioned, auditable, and idempotent. Administrators can activate or deactivate rule groups without redeploying pipelines.

### Explainability and Governance Alignment
Each anomaly record carries the lineage of the rule, data slice, condition, and computed deviation. These artifacts provide traceability for audits and root-cause analysis.

## Functional Objectives

| Capability | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Detection | Identify abnormal patterns in tenant business data such as revenue drops, expense spikes, missing payments, or data volume irregularities. |
| Classification | Tag anomalies by type (threshold, trend, completeness, correlation) and severity (critical, major, minor). |
| Attribution | Link anomalies back to their source dataset, KPI, and transformation step for traceability. |
| Feedback Loop | Allow tenant analysts to review anomalies, mark as valid or false, and refine future thresholds. |
| Actionability | Integrate with workflow engine or alert systems to trigger tasks, escalations, or notifications. |
| Extensibility | Support integration with machine learning models without structural change to schemas or contracts. |
| Auditability | Maintain complete logs of rule definitions, execution runs, and resulting anomalies for compliance reviews. |

---

## Functional Scope and Boundaries

This module is part of the **tenant application feature set**, not a host-level monitoring service. Its responsibilities are limited to detection, classification, and notification.  
It does not correct data or alter pipeline execution unless explicitly configured through workflow actions.  
For compliance reasons, results are stored and surfaced only within the tenant’s security boundary.

---

## Rule-Based Engine (Implemented Scope)

The rule engine evaluates structured expressions over aggregated business metrics. Each rule is defined declaratively, referencing standardized KPI identifiers.

### Rule Schema Example

```yaml
apiVersion: anomaly.v1
kind: Rule
metadata:
  ruleId: gross_margin_drift
  tenantId: t_23fd
spec:
  target: kpi_financials
  metric: gross_margin_percent
  period: monthly
  condition: deviation_gt
  threshold: 0.1
  baseline: trailing_6_months
  severity: high
  actions:
    - type: alert
    - type: workflow
      workflowId: wf_review_finance
```

The controller interprets this rule as: *“If the current month’s gross margin deviates by more than ten percent from the median of the last six months, record an anomaly and alert Finance.”*

### Supported Rule Types

| Category | Example | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Threshold | metric > fixed limit | Detects absolute breaches |
| Relative Deviation | Δ% vs historical median | Detects trend shifts |
| Completeness | expected record volume missing | Detects partial pipeline drops |
| Correlation | KPI A rises while KPI B falls | Detects contradictory movements |
| Distribution | change in variance or skew | Detects instability in spread |

### Rule Evaluation Pipeline
1. Scheduler triggers evaluation on data update events.  
2. Controller fetches all active rules for the tenant.  
3. Relevant datasets are retrieved from KPI marts.  
4. Rule expressions are computed in memory or SQL execution contexts.  
5. Results are persisted into the anomaly registry table.  
6. Downstream integrations consume new anomaly events through the event bus.

Each evaluation run is immutable. Rule modifications create new versions, preserving history.

## Data Flow and Integration Points

| Stage | Input | Output | Description |
|-------|--------|---------|-------------|
| GDP Ingestion | ERP, CRM, and external sources | normalized tables | provides base signals |
| KPI Computation | GDP layer | derived KPIs | produces metrics for anomaly analysis |
| Anomaly Evaluation | KPI tables | anomaly events | detects deviations |
| Workflow Integration | anomaly events | alerts, tickets | enforces review or remediation |
| Reporting | anomaly registry | dashboards, exports | visualizes results |

Modules involved:
- **Pipelines:** supplies trigger events and schedule context.  
- **Tenancy:** provides configuration isolation and access enforcement.  
- **Commercial-Ops:** consumes financial anomaly data for cost optimization.  
- **Governance:** subscribes to anomaly events for audit evidence.  
- **Access:** validates user roles for anomaly APIs.

---

## ML-Based Engine (Deferred Scope)

The architecture reserves extension points for predictive or adaptive detection.

Planned features:
- Unsupervised outlier detection using autoencoders or clustering models.  
- Seasonal forecasting to detect deviations from expected patterns.  
- Peer comparison baselines across similar tenants (optional, opt-in).  
- Confidence scoring for anomaly prioritization.  

The ML engine will use the same anomaly registry schema and will generate the same event payloads.  
Its addition will not require tenant reconfiguration.

---

## Tenant Interaction Model

Tenants can interact with the module through three surfaces:

### API Layer
Endpoints support CRUD operations for rules, manual evaluations, and result queries.  
APIs are fully tenant-scoped, using headers `X-Tenant-Id`, `X-Env`, and `X-Request-Id`.  
Responses include anomaly counts, rule metadata, and pagination for large result sets.

### Workflow Integration
Detected anomalies can automatically generate tasks, notifications, or change requests through the workflow engine.  
Administrators define routing policies based on severity and category.

### Visualization Layer
Anomaly dashboards provide charts showing frequency, impacted KPIs, and resolution status.  
Users can filter by rule, severity, or time range.  
Future releases will support side-by-side views of historical baselines and actual values for context.

---

## Security and Data Residency

All anomaly records are stored under the tenant’s defined region and encryption policy.  
Data never leaves the tenant boundary.  
The module follows platform-wide security standards:
- TLS for every API call  
- Role-based authorization enforced through Access module  
- Encryption at rest with per-tenant keys  
- Audit events recorded for every create, update, and evaluate operation  

Only aggregated non-sensitive metrics (counts, latency) are exported to host observability.

---

## Observability and Metrics

Operational metrics are published to help administrators monitor module health.

| Metric | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| anomaly_rule_evaluation_seconds | Time taken to evaluate rules |
| anomaly_events_created_total | Count of new anomalies generated |
| anomaly_rule_execution_failures | Number of rule runs that failed |
| anomaly_false_positive_ratio | Percentage of anomalies later dismissed |
| anomaly_pipeline_trigger_lag_seconds | Delay between data update and anomaly evaluation |

These metrics feed host dashboards but never expose business values.

---

## Tenant Use Cases

1. **Finance Tenant:** Detect revenue anomalies exceeding variance limits before financial close.  
2. **Operations Tenant:** Identify production yield dips compared to historical medians.  
3. **Sales Tenant:** Catch sudden conversion rate declines or pipeline volatility.  
4. **Procurement Tenant:** Monitor purchase order delays or unexpected cost escalations.  
5. **Compliance Tenant:** Detect missing transactions required for statutory reporting.  

Each tenant can customize rule packs or import standard templates supplied by the platform.

---

## Example End-to-End Flow

1. A tenant’s KPI pipeline publishes the daily sales summary.  
2. Event bus notifies anomaly controller that KPI table has changed.  
3. Controller retrieves applicable rules for that tenant.  
4. Evaluation detects an abnormal 20 percent dip in revenue versus baseline.  
5. Anomaly registry records the event with severity and context.  
6. Workflow engine generates an alert for the sales operations group.  
7. Governance module receives event copy for audit log.  
8. Tenant dashboard reflects the new anomaly with status "open."  
9. Analyst reviews data, confirms validity, and marks resolved.  
10. Feedback updates false-positive metrics for that rule.

---

## Extension and Customization

Tenants can extend default rule libraries with their own logic or adjust default severities.  
Each rule pack is namespaced and versioned.  
System packs include:
- Finance Rules Pack  
- Operations Rules Pack  
- Sales Rules Pack  
- Custom Rules (tenant-defined)  

Configuration manifests define parameter ranges, baselines, and scoring formulas.  
The controller validates all expressions at load time to prevent execution errors.

---

## Limitations and Known Gaps

- Predictive modeling deferred to later phase.  
- No automatic remediation unless integrated with workflow engine.  
- Rule dependencies (e.g., multi-stage conditions) limited to simple boolean expressions.  
- Requires consistent KPI refresh schedule for meaningful baselines.  
- Visualization limited to tenant dashboards; no cross-tenant comparison.  

---

## Summary

The Anomaly Detection Module enables each tenant to embed continuous intelligence into its operational data flow.  
It converts raw metric fluctuations into actionable insights without human intervention.  
By combining rule-based precision with transparent auditability, the system delivers immediate business value while laying a foundation for future ML-driven detection.  
Every anomaly detected is explainable, traceable, and bound to the tenant’s secure data domain—ensuring reliability, governance compliance, and confidence in every reported metric.
