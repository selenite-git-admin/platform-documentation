# Anomaly Detection Module â€” Data Models

Audience: Platform engineers, data engineers, DBAs  
Status: Version 1.0  
Purpose: Define the persistent schema for tenant scoped anomaly detection, including rules, runs, events, statuses, notifications, and catalogs. The design supports deterministic rule based detection today and extends to ML scoring without structural change.

---

## Modeling principles

- Tenant isolation first. Every record carries `tenant_id` and is partitioned by tenant and time where applicable.  
- Immutable facts and mutable status. Detection events are immutable. Resolution state is mutable and versioned.  
- Idempotency and replay. Identifiers include natural keys that avoid duplication during retries.  
- History by design. Rule specs and configuration snapshots are stored for audit and reproducibility.  
- Extension safe. ML detections reuse the same event envelope with additional fields in a side table.

## Reference integrity

- anomaly_status.event_id references anomaly_event.event_id and must match tenant_id.  
- event_tag, event_delivery, event_note, event_attr, event_link, and event_ml_ext all reference anomaly_event.event_id and tenant_id.  
- anomaly_event.rule_id references tenant_rule.rule_id for the same tenant_id.  
- Deleting an event cascades to deliveries, notes, tags, attrs, links, and ml ext unless retention policy requires freeze.

---

## Partitioning and retention

Recommended partitioning strategy  
- anomaly_event partitioned by month and tenant id.  
- anomaly_status co located with anomaly_event partitions.  
- Delivery and note tables partitioned by month.

Retention policy  
- Events kept for 180 to 730 days by tenant policy.  
- Deliveries kept for 90 days.  
- Notes and tags retained with events.  
- Jobs and run metadata retained for 90 to 180 days.

Archival moves closed partitions to colder storage while preserving query access through external tables.

---

## Idempotency keys

For safe retries, the natural id for an anomaly is the tuple  
(tenant_id, rule_id, metric, period_key, request_id)  
The engine must not write duplicate events for the same tuple.  
This guard supports manual replays and network retries without duplication.

## Sample DDL (PostgreSQL)

The following subset demonstrates core constraints. Production schemas may include storage options not shown here.

```sql
create table anomaly_event (
  event_id text primary key,
  tenant_id text not null,
  rule_id text not null,
  metric text not null,
  period_key text not null,
  baseline_fn text not null,
  baseline_window int,
  baseline_value numeric,
  current_value numeric,
  deviation numeric,
  deviation_pct numeric,
  severity text not null,
  source_table text,
  run_id text,
  request_id text not null,
  correlation_id text,
  created_at timestamptz not null default now()
);

create unique index uq_anomaly_event_natural
  on anomaly_event(tenant_id, rule_id, metric, period_key, request_id);

create table anomaly_status (
  event_id text primary key references anomaly_event(event_id) on delete cascade,
  tenant_id text not null,
  state text not null,
  note text,
  updated_at timestamptz not null default now(),
  updated_by text not null
);
```

---

## Query patterns

- Recent anomalies by severity for a tenant  
```sql
select * from anomaly_event
where tenant_id = $1
  and created_at >= now() - interval '7 days'
  and severity in ('critical','high')
order by created_at desc;
```

- Event with full context  
```sql
select e.*, s.state, s.note
from anomaly_event e
left join anomaly_status s on s.event_id = e.event_id
where e.event_id = $1;
```

- Rule performance statistics  
```sql
select rule_id, count(*) as events, avg(deviation_pct) as avg_dev
from anomaly_event
where tenant_id = $1
  and created_at between $2 and $3
group by rule_id
order by events desc;
```

---

## Privacy and security

- All tables include tenant_id and follow tenant encryption keys.  
- Access paths are restricted by role and tenant scope.  
- Exports use signed URLs with short expiry.  
- Sensitive notes should avoid PII; enforce redaction on ingest if required by policy.

---

## Migration guidance

- Introduce new optional columns with defaults and backfill asynchronously.  
- Use views for compatibility when reshaping attributes.  
- For heavy partitions, perform rolling maintenance during off peak hours.  
- Keep DDL changes versioned and apply with transactional migrations.

---

## Summary

The data model separates immutable facts from mutable resolution state and keeps tenant isolation central.  
It supports replay safe evaluations, efficient retrieval, and detailed audit trails.  
The schema provides a stable foundation for rule based detection today and seamlessly accommodates ML scoring in future releases.
