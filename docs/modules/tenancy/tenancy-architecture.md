# Tenancy Module Architecture

## Position In The Platform

The tenancy architecture sits in the control plane layer of the platform. It governs lifecycle management, resource mapping, and policy enforcement across all tenant contexts. It provides the single source of truth for tenant identity, isolation mode, region placement, and policy state.

Tenancy integrates with the following major subsystems:
- Governance for residency, encryption, and retention validation
- Commercial Operations for subscription plan binding and quota limits
- Access for identity binding and authentication domain setup
- Runtime for environment provisioning and workload orchestration
- Observability for metrics, logging, and incident traceability

The design ensures that every lifecycle event in any of these modules can be traced back to a consistent tenant identity.

## Objectives

The architecture aims to provide a deterministic and repeatable way to manage tenants at scale while maintaining isolation, auditability, and operational safety.

Key objectives:
- Support both shared and dedicated tenancy modes with identical lifecycle logic
- Ensure strong policy enforcement before any mutating action
- Maintain a uniform control model for provisioning, updates, and archival
- Provide clear operational semantics through observability and predictable events
- Guarantee recovery and replayability of tenant lifecycle actions

## Deployment Profiles

### Multi Tenant Profile
Multi tenant mode uses shared infrastructure for multiple tenants while maintaining logical separation. Isolation is achieved using schema boundaries, tenant scoped credentials, and policy enforcement in the control and data planes. This model enables faster provisioning, lower cost, and centralized governance.

### Single Tenant Profile
Single tenant mode provisions dedicated resources for a specific customer. It isolates compute, storage, and network at the physical or virtual level. This mode is used for customers with strict compliance or performance requirements. It provides maximal control at the expense of cost and provisioning time.

The same manifest schema, tenant identifier format, and API surface are used in both modes.

## Logical Components

The architecture is composed of the following primary components. Each runs independently and communicates through well defined APIs and event streams.

### Tenant Registry
A persistent and authoritative store for all tenant identities, metadata, and configuration parameters. It maintains versioned records of tenant state transitions and provides APIs for search, retrieval, and audit. The registry enforces immutability of tenant IDs and keeps lineage for all changes.

### Tenant Controller
A stateless control loop responsible for reconciling desired tenant state against runtime reality. It runs continuously, consumes events from queues, and performs create, update, suspend, resume, or archive operations as needed.  
Controllers are horizontally scalable, idempotent, and resilient to transient failures. Every operation is retried with exponential backoff and correlated through request IDs and manifest versions. The control loop ensures that eventual consistency is achieved even during failures or restarts.

### Isolation Strategy Layer
Defines how each tenantâ€™s resources are separated within the infrastructure. It determines schema-per-tenant for multi tenant models or full stack separation for single tenant deployments. This layer emits placement and residency metadata to the provisioning and governance systems. It ensures that every tenant resource can be traced to its isolation boundary.

### Lifecycle Orchestrator
Coordinates complex workflows that span multiple modules such as activation, suspension, migration, and archival. It sequences API calls, validates policy gates, and monitors step completion.  
The orchestrator publishes detailed progress events, handles retries with backoff, and guarantees that workflows are idempotent. If any sub step fails, the orchestrator records the state and resumes from the last successful checkpoint during retries.

### Policy And Audit Hooks
Provide enforcement and observability across all actions. Policy hooks evaluate compliance rules before operations proceed. Audit hooks log every successful or failed transition with correlation metadata.  
An operation that cannot be audited is treated as a failed operation. Audit trails are immutable and feed downstream analytics for compliance reporting.

## Control Plane Execution Model

The control plane uses declarative manifests to define desired state for every tenant. Controllers and orchestrators continuously reconcile this state with the actual environment.

Execution flow:
1. A tenant manifest is submitted through the API.
2. Validation ensures policy, plan, and region constraints are satisfied.
3. The manifest is written to the registry with a version identifier.
4. Controllers detect the version change and enqueue a reconcile task.
5. The reconcile worker processes the task, applies resource mutations, and emits events.
6. Observability and audit systems record results and latency metrics.

The control plane is event driven and uses distributed work queues. Every task includes correlation identifiers and retry policies.  
Workers run idempotent handlers, so reprocessing the same task does not cause duplication. Backoff intervals are used to avoid congestion, and queue depth is monitored to maintain steady state throughput.

## Eventing And Webhooks

All major lifecycle changes generate structured events that are published to the internal event bus and optionally to external subscribers through webhooks.

**Event Types:** created, activated, suspended, resumed, archived, deleted, plan updated, region migrated.  
**Delivery Guarantees:** at least once delivery with sequence numbers and replay support.  
**Payloads:** signed JSON structures that include tenant ID, correlation ID, previous state, new state, and timestamp.  
**Failure Handling:** webhook retries follow exponential backoff with jitter. After maximum attempts, undelivered messages are placed in a dead letter stream for operator review and requeue.

Operators can monitor delivery metrics, view webhook failure counts, and requeue messages manually or through automation.  
Every webhook invocation is logged with latency, status code, and retry count to support audit and incident review.

## Placement And Residency

Placement decisions determine the physical or logical region where tenant resources are deployed. Residency rules enforce compliance with data locality requirements.

**Inputs:** tenant manifest, allowed regions list, preferred region, plan code, and residency policy.  
**Decision Process:** a placement resolver selects a valid region and isolation mode.  
**Outputs:** placement metadata stored in the registry and emitted to provisioning pipelines.  
Out of policy requests are rejected early with clear error responses. Policy evaluation is mandatory and consistent across all modules.

Region migration follows a controlled workflow managed by the Lifecycle Orchestrator. The process validates residency, provisions target resources, copies configuration and data, verifies cutover, and retires old resources.

## Quotas And Rate Limits

Quota and rate limit enforcement occur at the control plane and API gateway levels.

**Quota Enforcement:**  
Each tenant has quotas derived from their plan code and modified by active policies. Quotas cover compute units, storage, events, and concurrent operations. Controllers check quotas before provisioning or scale up actions. Quota violations generate clear error messages and are logged for governance reporting.

**Rate Limiting:**  
API endpoints apply rate limits per tenant and per method. Exceeding rate limits returns HTTP 429 with recommended retry headers. Administrative overrides can be configured temporarily for recovery operations but must be audited.

Quota and rate limit data are stored in the registry and versioned to allow historical comparison and billing alignment.

## Migration And Failover

Migration workflows support movement between tenancy modes or regions. The architecture defines standardized paths for each type of migration.

**Multi Tenant To Single Tenant Migration:**  
- Validation of current resource usage and plan eligibility  
- Creation of dedicated infrastructure stack for the tenant  
- Controlled data migration with dual write window if required  
- Verification and cutover with rollback capability  
- Audit of all steps with timestamps and actor identity  

**Region Failover:**  
- Definition of standby region and replication strategy  
- Validation of data synchronization and readiness  
- Execution of failover runbook when the primary region is degraded  
- Verification and post failover consistency checks  
- Update of placement metadata and notification of dependent systems  

The orchestrator handles these workflows with checkpointing and rollback safety. All steps emit audit and metric events.

## Observability And SLOs

Observability ensures operational visibility across controllers, orchestrators, and APIs. All actions emit structured logs and metrics tagged with tenant and region identifiers.

**Metrics:**  
- Reconcile duration and success rate  
- Queue depth and processing throughput  
- Webhook delivery latency and failure counts  
- Policy evaluation latency and decision distribution  
- Controller error frequency by category  

**Alerts:**  
- Repeated reconcile failures for a tenant  
- Event backlog above threshold  
- Policy service unavailability  
- Webhook delivery rate below SLO  

**Dashboards:**  
Visualizations show per region, per tenant, and per controller performance. Dashboards link directly to runbook procedures.  
Alerts include runbook references to guide incident response. SLOs define acceptable thresholds for latency and reliability.

## Audit Model

The audit layer records every meaningful change and operational event. Each audit record includes tenant ID, actor, action, target resource, previous state, new state, request ID, and correlation ID.  
Audit logs are immutable and stored in a write optimized repository. They are indexed for search and exported periodically to compliance systems.

Audit integrity is guaranteed by digital signing and write acknowledgment. Any operation that fails to record an audit entry is automatically rolled back or retried until successful.  
Audit data supports incident reconstruction, compliance validation, and usage analysis.

## Resource Mapping Examples

| Tenant Type | Isolation Strategy | Example Mapping |
|--------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| Multi Tenant | Schema per tenant | database: shared, schema: tenant_id |
| Single Tenant | Dedicated database | database: tenant_id, schema: public |
| Hybrid | Shared control plane, isolated data plane | control DB shared, data DB isolated |

Mapping examples must be used only as guidance. Production deployment uses manifests and policies to define actual topology.

## Security Posture

The architecture inherits and enforces all platform security baselines.

**Identity and Access:**  
Controllers, orchestrators, and API layers use scoped roles. Credentials are rotated automatically and scoped per environment. Break glass roles require governance approval and are time limited.

**Encryption:**  
All data at rest and in transit is encrypted using platform managed keys. Each tenant may have unique encryption materials depending on isolation level.

**Secrets Management:**  
Secrets are stored in a secure store with access control enforced by service identity. No secret is stored in manifests or logs.  
Decryption is handled at runtime with short lived tokens.

**Audit and Compliance:**  
All access to tenant data or configuration is logged. Policy checks are mandatory before any data retrieval or modification. Compliance reports are generated from audit logs without manual intervention.

## Lifecycle Integration

Tenancy controllers integrate tightly with Governance and Commercial Operations modules to maintain consistent lifecycle semantics.  
Governance validates each state transition against residency, encryption, and retention policies.  
Commercial Operations binds plan codes, adjusts quotas, and emits billing events when lifecycle changes occur.

The lifecycle sequence follows the canonical states: Draft, Active, Suspended, Archived, Deleted. Each state transition is recorded and validated.

## Configuration Surfaces

The architecture exposes configuration through:
- Declarative YAML manifests for tenant definition and updates
- Management APIs for runtime control
- Operator CLI for diagnostics and maintenance
- Observability dashboards for metrics and logs
- Event streams and webhooks for integrations

Manifests are the source of truth. Runtime configuration is read only. Any manual drift is corrected automatically by controllers.

## Cross Module Contracts

The following contracts are stable and versioned:
- Tenant manifest schema  
- Event payload definitions  
- API endpoints and response structures  
- Audit record format  
- Policy evaluation request and response model  
- Webhook payload structure  

Versioning ensures backward compatibility and safe upgrades. All breaking changes follow a deprecation process with communication to dependent teams.

## Invariants

- Tenant identity is immutable  
- Every lifecycle transition is auditable  
- Policy enforcement precedes mutation  
- Controllers are idempotent  
- All operations are recoverable through replay  
- No state change bypasses the control plane  
- Observability data must be emitted for every reconcile run  

## Design And Security Notes Restored

The architecture has been reviewed for fault tolerance, policy isolation, and operational scalability. The design supports linear growth in tenants and ensures that adding new controllers or orchestrators does not affect existing tenants. The system design favors strong consistency of control data and eventual consistency of runtime resources.  

Tenancy remains the anchor for all platform-level guarantees around identity, policy, and isolation. Future versions may introduce controller sharding, event partitioning, and predictive scaling but the core principles of declarative intent, auditability, and safety will remain unchanged.
