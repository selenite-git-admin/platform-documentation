# Tenancy Module — Overview

> **Audience:** Solution architects, platform engineers, DevOps  
> **Status:** Draft v0.1  
> **Purpose:** Introduces the Tenancy module, its design philosophy, responsibilities, and its role as the foundational layer of isolation and lifecycle management across the platform.

---

## 1. Introduction

The Tenancy module defines the way organizations, environments, and users are provisioned, isolated, and managed across the platform. It ensures that each customer, workspace, or business unit operates in a logically and operationally independent context, preserving both **data sovereignty** and **system reliability**.

Tenancy is not an implementation detail—it is the structural contract between the platform and every deployed instance of a customer’s data or workload. It dictates **who owns what**, **where workloads run**, **how data is isolated**, and **how policies apply** across lifecycles.

---

## 2. Core Objective

To provide a **standardized, policy-driven foundation** that governs all customer and environment-level operations, enabling the platform to operate in both **multi-tenant (shared)** and **single-tenant (dedicated)** configurations—without branching logic or duplicated systems.

The module achieves this through a set of composable components:
- **Tenant Registry:** Central source of truth for tenant identities, metadata, and configurations.  
- **Tenant Controller:** Lifecycle manager that executes provisioning, updates, suspension, and archival.  
- **Isolation Strategies:** Plug-in model to enforce logical or physical separation.  
- **Lifecycle Orchestrator:** Event-driven engine that handles transitions between operational states.  
- **Policy Integration Hooks:** Interfaces to Governance, Commercial-Ops, and Runtime modules.

---

## 3. Problem Context

As platforms scale to hundreds of customers, ad-hoc provisioning approaches become unmanageable. Separate databases, custom IAM roles, and manual configurations cause fragmentation and unpredictability.  
Without a unified tenancy model:
- **Isolation** becomes inconsistent.  
- **Billing and governance** lose traceability.  
- **Environment provisioning** drifts across teams.  
- **Security boundaries** erode over time.  

The Tenancy module eliminates these inconsistencies by introducing **one declarative interface** that encodes tenant identity, isolation strategy, and operational policy in a repeatable way.

---

## 4. Design Principles

| Principle | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| **Isolation by Default** | Every resource, API, or job is scoped to a tenant context. Cross-tenant access must be explicitly declared and policy-approved. |
| **Declarative Provisioning** | Tenants are defined and managed through YAML manifests or APIs, enabling reproducibility and auditability. |
| **Composability** | Tenancy services are modular—used by Access, Governance, Schema, and Runtime without duplication. |
| **Immutability of Identity** | Tenant IDs are globally unique and immutable, ensuring traceability across environments and logs. |
| **Auditability** | All lifecycle transitions (create, update, suspend, delete) generate immutable governance events. |
| **Profile Parity** | Both Multi-Tenant and Single-Tenant models share the same identity schema and lifecycle logic. |

---

## 5. Responsibilities

The module governs the following responsibilities:

1. **Tenant Provisioning**  
   Creates new tenants and initializes their environments, credentials, and resource mappings.  

2. **Lifecycle Management**  
   Handles activation, suspension, archival, and deletion through event-driven orchestration.  

3. **Environment Hierarchy**  
   Supports dev, staging, and production subcontexts per tenant, maintaining parity across environments.  

4. **Resource Isolation**  
   Applies compute, network, and storage policies according to the selected deployment profile (MT or ST).  

5. **Usage & Billing Linkage**  
   Exposes hooks to Commercial-Ops for usage metering and cost attribution.  

6. **Policy Enforcement**  
   Integrates with the Governance module to apply retention, residency, and encryption rules per tenant.  

---

## 6. Key Components

### **Tenant Registry**
Centralized database and API layer for storing tenant identities, states, environment topologies, and isolation strategy metadata.

### **Tenant Controller**
A stateless control loop that ensures the actual resource state matches the desired manifest definition. It drives provisioning, lifecycle updates, and reconciliation.

### **Isolation Strategy Layer**
Defines how each tenant’s resources are physically and logically separated. Supports shared or dedicated deployments using a unified interface.

### **Lifecycle Orchestrator**
Listens to state transitions (Draft → Active → Suspended → Archived) and triggers automated workflows for each phase.

### **Policy & Audit Hooks**
Emit events to Governance for compliance tracking, and notify Commercial-Ops for billing alignment.

---

## 7. Interaction with Other Modules

| Module | Interaction |
|---------|--------------|
| **Access** | Manages user-to-tenant bindings and validates tokens against Tenant Registry. |
| **Governance** | Consumes tenancy lifecycle events for audit trails and compliance validation. |
| **Commercial-Ops** | Subscribes to usage metrics emitted by Tenancy for billing and plan enforcement. |
| **Runtime/Orchestrator** | Executes workloads under tenant-specific queues, namespaces, or worker pools. |
| **Schema-Registry** | Applies schema migrations per tenant environment context. |

---

## 8. Lifecycle States

| State | Meaning |
|--------|----------|
| **Draft** | Tenant registered but not yet provisioned. |
| **Active** | Fully operational tenant with active environments. |
| **Suspended** | Access temporarily restricted due to policy, billing, or compliance reasons. |
| **Archived** | Data retained under retention policy, compute deallocated. |
| **Deleted** | Tenant permanently removed after retention expiry. |

State transitions are governed by the Lifecycle Orchestrator and recorded in the Governance Ledger.

---

## 9. Deployment Profiles

The module supports both operational models natively:
- **Multi-Tenant:** Shared infrastructure with strong logical isolation. Best for SMBs and fast onboarding.  
- **Single-Tenant:** Dedicated infrastructure per customer for regulated industries or high-compliance contexts.  

Both share identical manifest formats, tenant IDs, and API contracts. The platform determines deployment type using the `profile` field in the tenant specification.

---

## 10. Expected Outcomes

- Uniform provisioning and isolation for all customers.  
- Fully auditable lifecycle with traceable events.  
- Scalable to thousands of tenants with minimal operational overhead.  
- Clear cost attribution through Commercial-Ops integration.  
- Foundation for consistent governance, compliance, and security enforcement.

---

## 11. Future Considerations

- **Cross-tenant analytics:** Controlled data sharing through opt-in collaboration models.  
- **Self-service tenant onboarding:** API-first workflows for customer provisioning.  
- **Policy-driven migrations:** MT→ST and ST→MT transitions through replayable manifests.  
- **Regional tenancy support:** Automatic placement and failover by geography.

---

**Summary:**  
The Tenancy module establishes a unified, auditable foundation for managing customer and environment lifecycles across both multi-tenant and single-tenant deployments. It is the platform’s anchor for identity, policy enforcement, and resource isolation—enabling scale without compromising control.
