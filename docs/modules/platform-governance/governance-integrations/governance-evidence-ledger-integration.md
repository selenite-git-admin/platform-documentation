# Governance â†” Evidence Ledger Integration

This note explains how Governance writes and replays evidence within the Evidence Ledger. It defines the interface, storage model, and verification process that guarantee auditability and immutability.

## Purpose

- Provide a tamper-proof audit trail of all promotion and policy decisions.  
- Enable deterministic replay of past governance states.  
- Maintain cryptographic integrity for every evidence record and its related bundles.

## Roles and Boundaries

- **Governance**: Authoritative service that creates and signs evidence bundles.  
- **Evidence Ledger**: Append-only store that persists evidence events and provides verification APIs.  
- **Audit Services**: Consumers that query and validate evidence chains for compliance or dispute resolution.

Governance owns the decision logic. The ledger owns durability, immutability, and proof generation.

## Ledger Write and Replay Flow

    participant Gov as Governance

    Gov->>Led: POST /ledger/evidence (evidence bundle)
    Led-->>Gov: ack { evidence_id, hash, merkle_root }
    Gov-->>Aud: emit governance.evidence.appended (ref = evidence_id)

    Aud->>Led: GET /ledger/evidence/{id}
    Led-->>Aud: evidence record, hash, signature, merkle_path
    Aud->>Gov: verify decision, policies, and signatures
```

## Evidence Bundle Schema

```json
{
  "evidence_id": "ev-2025-10-14-11-12-00-001",
  "subject_ref": "dataset:gdp.sales.orders.v3",
  "decision_ref": "dec-2025-10-14-1100",
  "snapshot_id": "snap-0a2b",
  "snapshot_hash": "merkle:e6b41b",
  "quality_score": 97.5,
  "rule_pack_version": "dqp-core@2.1.0",
  "policy_versions": ["schema@4.3.1", "privacy@2.0.0"],
  "signers": ["policy-engine", "approver-admin"],
  "inputs": ["hash:abc123", "hash:def456"],
  "timestamp": "2025-10-14T11:12:00Z",
  "decision": "allow",
  "hash": "sha256:e9bf32...",
  "merkle_path": ["sha256:aa1...", "sha256:bb2..."]
}
```

Each record is immutable once written. The `hash` field is a deterministic digest of the serialized bundle. The `merkle_path` links the record to its batch root.

## Storage, Hashing, and Verification Rules

- Evidence records are batched by time window and tenant.  
- Each batch forms a Merkle tree; the root hash is persisted separately.  
- Governance and Ledger both compute the hash and verify equality before accepting the write.  
- The ledger rejects duplicates or mismatched hashes.  
- Verification proofs can be reconstructed using stored paths and roots.

## Replay and Audit Process

1. Auditor retrieves the evidence_id or range.  
2. Ledger returns the serialized record, hash, and merkle_path.  
3. Auditor recomputes the hash and validates signatures and root inclusion.  
4. Governance cross-checks that referenced policies, rule packs, and snapshots still exist.  
5. Audit tools reconstruct promotion chains for a given dataset or KPI.

Replays are deterministic: the same evidence_id and snapshot_hash must yield the same Merkle proof.

## Failure and Recovery

- If ledger write fails, Governance retries with the same evidence_id (idempotent).  
- If verification mismatch occurs, the record is quarantined and an alert is raised.  
- Ledger failures do not delete prior data; they pause new writes until consistency is restored.  
- Recovery includes rehashing batches and recalculating Merkle roots.

## Security and Compliance

- Evidence Ledger is append-only, encrypted at rest, and signed per batch.  
- Access is restricted to Governance and authorized auditors.  
- Hash algorithms are versioned and rotated periodically.  
- Retention aligns with jurisdictional data governance policies.  
- Each record includes signer certificates and audit chain references.

## API Summary

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| POST | /ledger/evidence | Appends an evidence bundle and returns ID, hash, and merkle_root |
| GET | /ledger/evidence/{id} | Reads a single record with hash and proof |
| GET | /ledger/evidence?range= | Returns records in a time or ID range |
| GET | /ledger/proof/{root} | Returns Merkle root and inclusion proof |
| GET | /ledger/verify/{id} | Validates a record hash against stored root |

The Evidence Ledger guarantees that every decision stored under Governance can be verified independently and reproduced at any time.
