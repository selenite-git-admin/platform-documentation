# Platform Governance

The **Platform Governance** family defines the control plane of DataJetty.  
It maintains the registries, policies, schemas, and evidentiary records that govern how data moves, evolves, and complies within the platform.  
These modules form the authoritative reference layer for lineage, schema integrity, and contractual consistency between producing and consuming systems.

Platform Governance does not process business data directly.  
Instead, it describes and validates how data must be handled across runtime environments.  
It provides policy resolution, contract registration, and immutable evidence recording for every governed action.  
This layer ensures that compliance, lineage, and traceability remain verifiable across all operational layers.

### Functional Coverage

- Defines and enforces governance policies, contracts, and schemas across the platform.  
- Manages canonical master data and shared reference sets.  
- Hosts registries for policies, data contracts, and schema definitions.  
- Tracks lineage obligations and records immutable evidence for audit and compliance.  
- Integrates governance decisions into runtime and quality planes for live enforcement.  
- Publishes authoritative metadata for acquisition, store, and intelligence modules.  
- Maintains business calendars and scheduling windows for jobs and reporting systems.
