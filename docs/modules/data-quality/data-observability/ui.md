# User Interface

## Goals
- Make state obvious: active/inactive/deprecated with reasons.
- Safe changes-by-default (preflight validation + diff view).
- Inline copy‑paste examples for API usage.

## Screens
- **List & Filters** — searchable by name, status.
- **Detail** — spec viewer, receipts, related resources.
- **Create/Update** — form with schema-backed validation.
- **Activity** — recent changes, alerts.

## Accessibility & UX
- Keyboard-first forms; validation messages concise and actionable.
- Explain breaking risks before save; confirm with evidence note.
