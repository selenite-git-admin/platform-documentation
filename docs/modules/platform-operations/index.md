# Platform Operations

The Platform Operations family delivers the runtime and edge services that keep DataJetty available, secure, and observable.  
It operates the execution layer where requests are routed, rate limits are enforced, incidents are reported, and system health is continuously monitored.  
This family applies the control and policy definitions maintained by Platform Subscription and Platform Control to live traffic and workloads.

Platform Operations is responsible for operational integrity.  
It evaluates every inbound request, applies authentication and entitlement context, and ensures the platform responds predictably even under failure conditions.  
It also manages notifications, incident ticketing, and controlled migrations to maintain uptime across environments.

### Functional Coverage

- Routes and secures API traffic at ingress with rate limits and policy enforcement.  
- Manages operational notifications and service-level alerts across components.  
- Integrates with incident-management systems for ticket creation and tracking.  
- Provides health probes and readiness endpoints for monitoring and orchestration.  
- Coordinates platform data migrations and version transitions with minimal disruption.  
- Acts as the operational counterpart to the policy and control layers, executing their rules at runtime.
