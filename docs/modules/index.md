# Modules

## Scope
This page is the entry point to the BareCount module catalog. It explains how modules are grouped and links to the pages that exist today. The goal is clarity about boundaries, not exhaustiveness.

## Families
- Host Modules
- Compute Modules
- Data Storage Modules
- Consumption Modules
- Action Modules
- Security Modules
- Access Modules
- Trust Modules
- Runtime Modules
- Data Utilities Modules

## Available module pages

### Host Modules

[Policy Registry](host/policy-registry/index.md)
Central registry for guardrail policies. Links: [Data Model](host/policy-registry/data-model.md), [UI](host/policy-registry/ui.md), [API](host/policy-registry/api.md), [Observability](host/policy-registry/observability.md), [Runbook](host/policy-registry/runbook.md), [Security](host/policy-registry/security.md)

[Data Contract Registry](host/data-contract-registry/index.md)
Catalog of dataset contracts and versions with proposal and review workflow. Links: [Data Model](host/data-contract-registry/data-model.md)

## Reading order
For each module follow this order:
1. Index
2. Data Model
3. UI
4. API
5. Observability
6. Runbook
7. Security

## Conventions
- Use the writing guardrails defined in the project
- Keep responsibilities and constraints concrete
- Avoid speculative statements
- Respect the image embedding pattern defined in references

## Progress tracking
