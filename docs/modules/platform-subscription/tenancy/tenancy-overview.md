# Tenancy Module Overview

## Introduction

Tenancy is the structural boundary that determines how organizations, environments, and workloads are named, isolated, and governed. It is the mechanism that dictates who can see which data, where the data lives, and how lifecycle actions apply across environments. Treat tenancy as the backbone of platform correctness, not as an implementation detail.

The module provides a canonical model for a tenant and a control plane that reconciles desired state against runtime state. The control plane is responsible for safe lifecycle operations, consistent isolation, dependable auditability, and standard integration points for external systems. The design aims to preserve data sovereignty and system reliability for every tenant and environment.

## Core Objective

**Objective:** Deliver a single, declarative tenancy model that works for both multi tenant and single tenant customers. The control plane must expose predictable APIs, emit reliable events, enforce governance, and provide clear operational procedures.

**Outcome:** Platform teams and product modules can integrate once with the tenancy model and operate consistently across environments and regions.

## Problem Context

Tenancy is often scattered across services and ad hoc configuration. This leads to weak isolation, inconsistent lifecycle semantics, and poor audit. The platform requires a cohesive model that centralizes tenant identity, lifecycle control, isolation strategy, and governance while remaining flexible for product evolution.

Failure modes to avoid include ambiguous tenant identifiers across modules, manual environment setup that drifts from declared state, missing or partial audit trails, and regional placement that ignores residency policy.

## Design Principles

**Tenant as a first class entity:** Every resource and operation must be attributable to a tenant identity and environment.

**Declarative intent over imperative mutation:** Desired state is captured in manifests. Controllers converge actual state to match the manifest.

**Isolation by default:** Isolation boundaries are enforced consistently in data, control, and network planes. Do not rely on application code alone.

**Policy before action:** Governance checks run before lifecycle operations are executed. Non compliant requests fail fast with actionable errors.

**Audit everywhere:** Every lifecycle transition and material change is recorded with correlation identifiers and actor context.

**Operational clarity:** Every operation is idempotent, observable, and recoverable. Procedures are explicit and reversible.

## Role In The Platform

Tenancy is the control point for onboarding, lifecycle, and isolation. It defines tenant records, orchestrates lifecycle transitions, validates policy, and publishes state for other modules to consume. It serves as the single source of truth for tenant metadata, topology, residency, quotas, and commercial plan binding. Other modules read this information to route workloads, enforce limits, and display correct tenant context.

## Responsibilities

**Create and manage tenant records:** Persist canonical identity, display name, contact info, and external references.

**Manage lifecycle states:** Support draft, active, suspended, and archived with idempotent transitions and validation.

**Record residency and regional placement:** Capture allowed regions and preferred region. Enforce placement during provisioning and migration.

**Bind commercial plan:** Associate a product plan code that drives feature flags and limits for subscription enforcement.

**Maintain contact roles:** Keep technical, billing, and incident contacts current for operations and escalations.

**Maintain external identifiers:** Store identifiers that map to billing or CRM so external systems can join and reconcile.

**Expose read APIs for search and profile lookup:** Provide fast indexed queries for console and system integrations.

**Publish events and webhooks:** Notify downstream systems about lifecycle changes and metadata updates.

**Provide guardrails and quotas:** Enforce resource limits and rate limits per plan and per tenant.

**Support migration workflows:** Provide structured procedures for multi tenant to single tenant moves and region failover.

## Non Goals

**Not a replacement for product specific configuration:** Individual services still own their internal configuration. Tenancy provides identity, lifecycle, isolation, and governance. Service teams map tenant identity to their own configuration.

**Not a billing engine:** Tenancy binds plan codes and publishes usage signals but does not compute invoices.

**Not a policy authoring system:** Governance policies are defined in the central policy service. Tenancy consumes them to validate lifecycle actions.

## Inputs

**Tenant creation request:** Name, profile, region policy, plan code, contacts, and external identifiers.

**Governance policies:** Residency rules, encryption requirements, retention rules, and allowed actions.

**Topology inventory:** Available regions, clusters, and resource templates.

**Commercial configuration:** Plan catalogs with features and limits.

**Identity integration:** Mappings for authentication domains and group assignments.

## Outputs

**Canonical tenant record:** Durable state with history, current attributes, and version.

**Lifecycle events:** Created, activated, suspended, resumed, archived, and deleted with correlation ids.

**Placement decision:** Resolved region and isolation mode for provisioning.

**Audit trail:** Structured entries with actor, action, target, and outcome.

**Derived configuration:** Quotas, rate limits, and feature flags derived from plan code and policy.

## Key Components

### Tenant Registry

The registry stores the canonical tenant record and supports indexed queries. It maintains uniqueness constraints, external id mappings, and environment scoping. It exposes search, get by id, and listing APIs. It version stamps changes for audit and rollback.

### Tenant Controller

The controller reconciles desired state against runtime state. It drives creation, activation, suspension, and archival while honoring policy decisions. It runs in a work queue model and is horizontally scalable. The controller is idempotent and tolerant of retries.

### Isolation Strategy Layer

This layer decides how resources are separated for a given tenant. It selects schema per tenant for shared databases, dedicated databases for single tenant customers, and network boundaries per environment. It emits placement metadata consumed by provisioning.

### Lifecycle Orchestrator

The orchestrator coordinates multi step workflows such as tenant activation or migration. It ensures external calls to identity, billing, and product modules are sequenced and retried safely. It publishes progress and completion events for observability.

### Policy And Audit Hooks

Policy evaluation runs before mutating actions. The evaluation combines tenant attributes, plan constraints, and residency rules. Audit writes are performed for every state change. Failure to audit is treated as a failed operation.

## Interaction With Other Modules

**UI:** The admin console supports onboarding, lifecycle changes, and metadata edits with server side validation and clear error messages. Screens present residency selection, plan selection, contacts, and external id mapping.

**API:** The API surface exposes tenant creation, update, lifecycle transitions, search, and profile retrieval. It supports pagination and filtering for large directories.

**Observability:** Tenancy publishes controller metrics, event delivery metrics, and policy enforcement metrics. Logs contain tenant id, environment, and correlation id to enable tracing.

**Runbook:** Operations can follow documented procedures for onboarding, suspending, resuming, migrating, and archiving. The runbook defines diagnostics and recovery steps.

**Security:** The module integrates with IAM, enforces least privilege for service roles, and supports encryption at rest and in transit. Key rotation intervals and credential scoping are defined per environment.

## Lifecycle States

**Draft:** Tenant record exists but resources are not provisioned. Allowed actions include update metadata and request activation. Policy checks run during activation.

**Active:** Resources are provisioned and reachable. Feature flags and quotas are applied. Allowed actions include suspend, update metadata, rotate keys, and migrate.

**Suspended:** Access is restricted due to compliance or commercial reasons. Workloads are paused or blocked based on policy. Allowed actions include resume or archive.

**Archived:** Tenant is retired. Data is retained per retention policy or moved to long term storage. Recovery requires a defined restore workflow.

**Deleted:** Terminal state for test tenants or explicit removal requests that satisfy policy. Deletion requires hard confirmation and audit.

## Deployment Profiles

**Multi tenant profile:** Shared control plane and shared data plane resources partitioned by tenant identifiers and schema separation. Suitable for standard plans and smaller footprints. Cost efficient and fast to provision. Isolation relies on policy and schema boundaries.

**Single tenant profile:** Dedicated infrastructure owned by a single customer. Dedicated databases, queues, and network segments. Required for customers with strict compliance, performance, or residency requirements. Higher cost and longer provisioning time.

**Hybrid profile:** Shared control plane with an isolated data plane. Useful when centralized operations are desired while meeting data isolation requirements.

## Isolation Model

**Data plane isolation:** Separate schemas or databases, separate encryption materials, and explicit access scopes. Data lineage and masking rules are enforced per tenant.

**Control plane isolation:** Namespace prefixes and scoped credentials for controllers, webhooks, and automation tasks. Only authorized components can mutate tenant resources.

**Network isolation:** Segregated subnets or dedicated VPCs for single tenant deployments. Private endpoints for control plane access. Cross region access is limited by residency rules.

## Governance And Compliance

**Residency enforcement:** Validate region choices and placement during provisioning. Reject out of policy regions with actionable error messages.

**Encryption and key rotation:** Enforce encryption at rest and in transit. Rotate keys on a schedule and on demand for incidents.

**Retention and deletion:** Apply retention schedules and ensure secure deletion or archival. Evidence generation should be automated.

**Access control:** Enforce least privilege with scoped roles. Apply break glass procedures with strong audit and expiration.

## Observability And Monitoring

**Metrics:** Controller reconcile duration, success and failure counts, queue depth, webhook delivery latency, and policy evaluation latency.

**Logs:** Structured entries with tenant id, environment, controller name, request id, and manifest version. Logs should support correlation across services.

**Alerts:** Trigger alerts on repeated reconcile failures, event backlog growth, policy evaluation service errors, and webhook delivery failures. Provide runbook links in alert annotations.

**Dashboards:** Provide per region and per tenant views to support SLO tracking and incident response.

## Operational Model

**Manifests as the source of truth:** Operators edit manifests and submit them through the API. Manual mutations in runtime systems are not permitted.

**Continuous reconciliation:** Controllers converge to desired state and correct drift. Reconciliation is safe to run repeatedly.

**Retry and backoff:** External calls use exponential backoff. Operations are designed to be idempotent to tolerate retries.

**Migration workflows:** Provide a structured path for multi tenant to single tenant migrations. Validate placement, perform data movement in a controlled window, and verify cutover.

**Region failover:** Define cold and warm standby options with explicit prerequisites and tests. Exercises should be run with synthetic tenants.

## Quotas And Rate Limits

**Quota model:** Quotas are derived from plan code and can be overridden by policy. Quotas include compute, storage, connections, and events. Quotas are validated during activation and monitored at runtime.

**Rate limits:** Apply limits per tenant and per endpoint. Return 429 with retry guidance. Provide administrative overrides with audit.

## Webhooks And Integrations

**Event delivery:** Deliver signed webhooks for lifecycle events. Include sequence numbers and support replay with idempotency keys.

**Failure handling:** Retry with backoff on transient errors. Move to a dead letter stream after max retries and provide operator tools for requeue.

**Consumers:** Billing, CRM, support systems, and analytics consume events. Maintain versioned payload contracts.

## API Surfaces

**Management API:** Create tenant, update attributes, transition lifecycle, search and list, retrieve placement. All mutating calls require policy evaluation.

**Read API:** Fetch profile by id or external id. Support filters by plan, region, and lifecycle state. Pagination is required for large directories.

**CLI:** Provide wrappers for common operations. Respect the same permissions and policy checks as the API.

## Data Model Summary

**Identity fields:** Tenant id, display name, external identifiers, and contact roles.

**Lifecycle fields:** State, requested state, created at, updated at, and archived at.

**Placement fields:** Allowed regions, preferred region, isolation mode, and residency flags.

**Commercial fields:** Plan code, feature set, quotas, and rate limits.

**Audit fields:** Actor, action, target, request id, and correlation id.

## Security Model

**IAM integration:** Use scoped roles for controllers, registry access, and webhook dispatchers. Rotate credentials frequently.

**Key management:** Use a managed KMS for encryption. Segregate keys per tenant or per environment based on isolation requirements.

**Secrets handling:** Store secrets in a secure manager with least privilege access. Avoid embedding secrets in manifests.

**Boundary tests:** Regularly test that a tenant cannot read or mutate resources across boundaries.

## Module Documentation Map

**UI:** Screens for onboarding, lifecycle transitions, metadata edits, and plan binding.

**API:** Operations for profile reads, lifecycle updates, search, and pagination.

**Observability:** Metrics, logs, and SLOs for control operations with tenant tagging.

**Runbook:** Procedures for routine operations, diagnostics, and incident handling.

**Security:** Classification, access control, encryption, and audit coverage.

## Expected Outcomes

**Consistent tenant experience:** Tenants are onboarded and managed the same way across environments and regions.

**Operational predictability:** Incidents are diagnosable with consistent logs, metrics, and events. Procedures are clear and repeatable.

**Compliance assurance:** Policy enforcement and audit provide strong evidence for reviews.

**Scale with confidence:** The model supports growth in number of tenants and workloads without sacrificing isolation.

## Future Considerations

**Blueprints for cloning and sandboxes:** Provide declared blueprints to clone tenants for testing and training with safe data handling.

**Automated compliance evidence:** Generate artifacts for audits from events and configuration snapshots.

**Anomaly detection:** Use signals to detect misconfigurations and suspicious behavior per tenant.

**Progressive delivery:** Support staged rollouts of manifest changes and plan upgrades.

## Summary

The Tenancy module defines how tenants are represented, isolated, governed, and operated. It provides the APIs, events, and procedures required to onboard and manage tenants with confidence. The design favors declarative intent, strong policy enforcement, and complete audit. The result is predictable operations and a clear foundation for product teams to build tenant aware features.
