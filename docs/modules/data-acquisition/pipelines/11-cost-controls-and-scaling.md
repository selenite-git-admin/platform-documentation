# Cost Controls and Scaling

## Purpose
The Cost Controls and Scaling stage ensures that pipelines in the BareCount Data Action Platform run efficiently without compromising reliability. It introduces mechanisms to control costs, manage scaling, and optimize compute usage across environments.

## Context
Enterprise pipelines can grow complex and expensive if left unchecked. Redundant processing, oversized infrastructure, and uncontrolled retention lead to waste. BareCount addresses these challenges by embedding cost controls into pipeline design. Scaling is elastic and policy-driven, ensuring that resources grow with demand but do not inflate costs unnecessarily.

## Key Capabilities

### Retention Classes
- Raw Stage data can be assigned different retention classes such as short-term, medium-term, or long-term.  
- Retention is contract-governed and aligned with compliance needs.  
- This prevents uncontrolled storage growth while preserving auditability.

### Elastic Scaling
- Pipelines scale compute dynamically based on data volume and schedule.  
- Auto-scaling applies to ingestion runners, transformation workers, and materialization processes.  
- Scaling policies are configurable per tenant to balance cost and performance.

### Intelligent Scheduling
- Non-critical jobs run in off-peak windows to take advantage of lower cloud costs.  
- Critical jobs reserve higher priority slots to meet freshness SLOs.  
- Scheduling decisions integrate with orchestration policies.

### Right-Sizing
- Historical metrics inform right-sizing of compute allocations.  
- Pipelines that consistently over-provision are flagged for review.  
- Operators can adjust resource profiles with contract-level updates.

### Cost Attribution
- Every run generates cost metrics tagged with tenant, pipeline, and run ID.  
- Costs are allocated back to business owners for visibility.  
- Dashboards show spend by connector, pipeline stage, and KPI, enabling accountability.

### Guardrails
- Quotas prevent runaway jobs from exceeding budgeted thresholds.  
- Anomalous spikes in cost generate alerts routed to operators.  
- Governance policies enforce pre-approval for unusually expensive runs or backfills.

## Operating Model
- Retention policies are defined in contracts and enforced automatically.  
- Scaling parameters are tuned using historical workload patterns.  
- Finance and operations teams review cost dashboards alongside pipeline SLO dashboards.  
- Cost governance is treated as a continuous process, not a one-time configuration.

## Example
A pipeline ingests sales transactions from Salesforce. During peak quarter-end, volumes increase fivefold. Auto-scaling adds transformation workers temporarily, ensuring KPIs remain fresh. At the same time, cost attribution logs show increased compute usage under the “Sales KPI” tenant. After quarter-end, workers scale down automatically. Dashboards confirm that extra costs were temporary and fully attributed.

## Notes
BareCount integrates cost controls with scaling to ensure sustainable operations. Enterprises can trust that data pipelines grow with demand while staying within budget. Efficiency and accountability are built into the platform, not left to chance.
