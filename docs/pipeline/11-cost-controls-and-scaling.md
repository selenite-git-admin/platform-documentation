# Cost Controls and Scaling

## Purpose
Control spend while keeping SLOs.
Scale with demand without surprises.

## Budgets
Define budgets per pipeline or per stage.
Track cost per run and per unit of data.

## Efficiency
Use partition pruning and predicate pushdown.
Batch data to fit optimal compute sizes.

## Storage
Tier storage by access pattern.
Expire old partitions by policy.

## Kill switches
Stop runaway runs when cost or time limits are hit.
