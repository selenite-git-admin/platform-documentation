# Host App — Tenant Management

## Purpose
Explains how tenants are managed in the Host App.  
Tenants represent logical customers, business units, or environments, and must be governed consistently.

---

## Capabilities
- Create — onboard with residency, calendars, quotas.  
- Update — modify metadata such as quotas or flags.  
- Suspend — disable without deleting.  
- Retire — archive with evidence export.  

All lifecycle actions require approvals and are logged.

---

## Safety Rails
- Residency changes need compliance approval.  
- Retire requires multi-party confirmation.  
- Quotas and calendars validated automatically.  

---

## Metadata
- Each tenant has unique ID.  
- Metadata covers residency, quotas, fiscal calendars, and org hierarchy.  
- Contracts and KPIs are scoped to tenant boundary.  

---

## Integration
- Reference Data — tenants inherit calendars and FX.  
- Contracts Governance — contracts published per tenant.  
- Audit — all tenant events recorded with evidence.  

---

## Why This Matters
Uncontrolled tenant changes risk quota misuse, compliance breaches, or data loss.  
Tenant management in the Host App enforces safe, traceable changes with proper evidence.
