# Tenant App – API Reference

This page embeds or links to the generated OpenAPI specification for the Tenant App back‑for‑frontend (BFF).  
It is intended for internal reference only. External integrations must use platform service APIs.

- **Source of truth**: `openapi/tenant-bff.yaml` (versioned).  
- **Changelog**: maintained alongside the spec.  
- **Compatibility**: semantic versioning with deprecation windows.  

> Note: Field‑level definitions for data contracts, KPIs, and activation flows are documented under their respective platform API references.
