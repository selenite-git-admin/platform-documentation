# Platform Runtime Foundations — Backup/DR & Retention

## Purpose
The Backup/DR & Retention service provides **resilience and compliance** for platform data.  
It ensures that tenant datasets can be restored within agreed objectives and that retention policies are consistently enforced across Bronze, Silver, GDP, and KPI layers.  
This capability protects against data loss, corruption, and regulatory violations.

## Responsibilities
- **Backup orchestration** — schedule full and incremental backups across all critical data stores.  
- **Disaster recovery (DR)** — define and enforce RPO (Recovery Point Objective) and RTO (Recovery Time Objective) policies.  
- **Test restores** — periodically verify backup integrity by restoring into isolated environments.  
- **Retention enforcement** — automatically delete or archive data per classification (e.g., PII, financial records).  
- **Evidence generation** — produce compliance logs and attestations of backup and retention actions.  

---

## Non-Goals
- Not a monitoring tool for real-time metrics (Telemetry handles that).  
- Not a governance workflow system (Host App sets policies, this enforces them).  
- Not responsible for tenant-level application backups outside the platform scope.  

---

## Flows
1. **Define** — Host App governance specifies retention periods, DR policies, and dataset classifications.  
2. **Backup** — Data Plane stores are backed up on schedule (full/incremental, hot/cold).  
3. **Restore** — DR exercises and test restores validate recovery readiness.  
4. **Enforce** — expired datasets are purged or archived in compliance with policy.  
5. **Report** — evidence and attestation exported to Host App for audit.  

---

## Interfaces
- **Host App** — provides governance rules for retention and DR objectives.  
- **Data Plane** — executes backup/restore operations on tenant datasets.  
- **Audit & Evidence** — captures logs and proofs of backup/retention activity.  
- **Telemetry** — monitors backup job success/failures and storage consumption.  

---

## Why This Matters
Without structured backup and retention controls, tenants face unacceptable risks of data loss, service outages, or regulatory penalties.  
By embedding resilient backup and DR services:
- **Executives** can assure regulators and customers of business continuity.  
- **Tenants** gain confidence that their critical data is safe and recoverable.  
- **Auditors** receive defensible evidence that retention and DR obligations are enforced.  

The Backup/DR & Retention service ensures the platform is **resilient, compliant, and continuously verifiable**.
