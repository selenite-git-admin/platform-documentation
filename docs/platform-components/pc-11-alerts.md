# Cross-Cutting — Alerts & Monitoring

## Purpose
The Alerts & Monitoring module ensures that both operators and business stakeholders receive timely, actionable signals about platform health and data reliability.  
It collects events from Control and Data planes, applies severity models, and routes alerts to the right audience through the right channel.  
This capability makes the platform observable without exposing raw tenant data.

## Responsibilities
- **System health alerts** — detect failures in ingestion, processing, orchestration, and delivery pipelines.  
- **Data quality alerts** — propagate validation or anomaly failures flagged by the Data Quality module.  
- **Threshold breaches** — raise alerts when KPI values exceed defined tolerance ranges.  
- **Routing & escalation** — send alerts to appropriate channels (ops teams, tenant admins, executives) based on severity and scope.  
- **Dashboards & status views** — provide consolidated health monitoring via Host App read-only panels.  

---

## Non-Goals
- Does not author data quality or anomaly rules (those come from Schema Services).  
- Does not serve as a tenant-facing BI tool (Tenant App handles reporting).  
- Does not replace full incident management systems — it integrates with them.  

---

## Flows
1. **Capture** — events are collected from Telemetry, Orchestration, and Data Quality checks.  
2. **Classify** — alerts are enriched with metadata (severity, tenant scope, component).  
3. **Route** — notifications are delivered to relevant audiences (e.g., ops team pager, tenant admin dashboard, executive digest).  
4. **Escalate** — unresolved alerts follow escalation paths defined in governance.  
5. **Visualize** — Host App surfaces read-only dashboards showing current and historical alert status.  

---

## Interfaces
- **Telemetry pipeline** — the primary source of metrics and error events.  
- **Data Quality & Anomalies** — provides validation and anomaly failure signals.  
- **Host App** — displays consolidated read-only health dashboards for governance visibility.  
- **Tenant App** — surfaces tenant-facing alerts scoped to their data and KPIs.  

---

## Why This Matters
Without structured alerts, issues go unnoticed until they become outages or audit findings.  
By centralizing monitoring and routing:
- **Operators** can act before failures impact tenants.  
- **Tenants** gain visibility into issues affecting their data without needing backend access.  
- **Executives and auditors** see that the platform is continuously monitored, proving operational maturity.  

The Alerts & Monitoring module ensures the platform is **observable, accountable, and resilient**.
