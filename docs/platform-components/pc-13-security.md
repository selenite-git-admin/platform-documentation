# Cross-Cutting — Security & RBAC

## Purpose
The Security & RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) module enforces identity, authentication, and authorization consistently across the platform.  
It ensures that only the right users, services, and tenants can access the right data, at the right time, under the right conditions.  
Security controls apply to both the Control Plane (governance) and the Data Plane (execution and delivery).

---

## Responsibilities
- **Identity federation** — integrate with enterprise identity providers (e.g., SAML, OIDC, LDAP).  
- **Authentication** — enforce strong, multi-factor authentication for all platform access.  
- **Authorization** — apply fine-grained role-based permissions at user, tenant, and service levels.  
- **Secrets management** — safeguard credentials, API keys, and tokens using centralized KMS-backed stores.  
- **Network boundaries** — restrict traffic to approved endpoints, enforce encryption in transit (TLS), and secure VPC isolation.  
- **Audit logging** — capture all access attempts, successes, and denials for compliance.  

---

## Non-Goals
- Does not define compliance residency rules (handled in Residency & Compliance).  
- Does not manage quotas or cost controls (handled in Cost & Quota Enforcement).  
- Does not compute or deliver KPIs (Data Plane function).  

---

## Flows
1. **Authenticate** — users and services authenticate through enterprise identity providers.  
2. **Authorize** — RBAC checks determine whether requested actions are permitted.  
3. **Enforce** — tenant boundaries and role scopes applied consistently across APIs, dashboards, and orchestration endpoints.  
4. **Log** — all access decisions are captured in immutable logs for audit.  
5. **Monitor** — suspicious patterns or failed attempts trigger alerts through the Alerts & Monitoring module.  

---

## Interfaces
- **Host App** — defines and manages governance-level roles and permissions.  
- **Tenant App** — enforces tenant-specific roles and data access policies.  
- **Secrets & Key Management** — issues scoped credentials and rotates keys.  
- **Alerts & Monitoring** — receives signals on failed or suspicious access attempts.  

---

## Why This Matters
Without strong, consistent security, the platform becomes vulnerable to data breaches, insider misuse, and compliance failures.  
By embedding security and RBAC into every layer:
- **Executives** can assure regulators and customers that sensitive data is protected.  
- **Tenants** gain confidence that their workloads are isolated and secure.  
- **Auditors** can verify that access is logged, controlled, and defensible.  

The Security & RBAC module ensures the platform is **secure, compliant, and trustworthy**.
