# Platform Runtime Foundations — Config & Artifacts

## Purpose
The Config & Artifacts service manages the **versioned storage and rollout** of all execution artifacts generated from approved contracts.  
It ensures that every tenant environment runs with the correct, validated configuration — reproducible at any point in time.  
This service ties Control Plane approvals to Data Plane execution with immutable, auditable artifacts.

---

## Responsibilities
- **Artifact registry** — store compiled execution plans, transformation scripts, and supporting assets.  
- **Versioning** — assign immutable versions to each artifact with lineage back to approved contracts.  
- **Rollout strategies** — support safe deployment methods (blue/green, canary, staged rollout).  
- **Attestation metadata** — capture provenance, signatures, and cryptographic checksums for compliance.  
- **Rollback support** — allow reversion to previous artifact versions without manual rework.  

---

## Non-Goals
- Does not author contracts or governance policies (Host App + Schema Services).  
- Does not run workloads (that is Orchestration & Data Plane scope).  
- Not a general-purpose artifact store — scoped only to platform execution artifacts.  

---

## Flows
1. **Compile** — PHS Control APIs generate materialization plans and supporting artifacts.  
2. **Register** — artifacts stored in registry with version, hash, and provenance metadata.  
3. **Deploy** — rollout initiated via orchestration with strategy (blue/green, canary).  
4. **Monitor** — telemetry captures deployment health, failures, or drift.  
5. **Rollback (if required)** — orchestration reverts to prior stable version.  

---

## Interfaces
- **PHS Control APIs** — provide compiled plans for artifact registration.  
- **Orchestration** — consumes artifacts for job scheduling and execution.  
- **Lineage & Metadata** — records artifact lineage and links to contract versions.  
- **Host App** — surfaces read-only artifact version history for governance evidence.  

---

## Why This Matters
Without versioned artifacts, execution environments drift silently — causing inconsistent KPIs, failed audits, and loss of trust.  
By enforcing immutable artifacts and controlled rollouts:
- **Engineers** can reliably reproduce workloads in any environment.  
- **Executives** can trust that tenant results come from approved and consistent configurations.  
- **Auditors** receive clear evidence that every execution is tied to an immutable, approved artifact.  

The Config & Artifacts service ensures the platform is **reproducible, controlled, and compliant**.
