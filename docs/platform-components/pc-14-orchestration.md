# Platform Runtime Foundations — Orchestration & Scheduling

## Purpose
The Orchestration & Scheduling service ensures that all workloads derived from approved contracts are executed reliably and predictably.  
It manages pipelines across the Data Plane, handling retries, error isolation, and run coordination.  
This capability sits at the heart of the runtime foundation, connecting governance intent with actual job execution.

---

## Responsibilities
- **Plan compilation** — accept materialization plans from PHS Control APIs and translate them into executable job graphs.  
- **Scheduling** — allocate resources and run jobs at the right time and frequency.  
- **Retry & backoff** — automatically retry failed steps with exponential backoff and failover policies.  
- **Idempotency** — guarantee that jobs can safely re-run without duplicating results.  
- **Dead-letter queues (DLQ)** — quarantine failed jobs for investigation without blocking other workloads.  
- **Run state tracking** — provide execution status and metrics to Telemetry and Host App dashboards.  

---

## Non-Goals
- Does not author or validate contracts (Schema Services handles this).  
- Does not store governance approvals or quotas (Host App scope).  
- Does not expose KPIs or dashboards to tenants (Tenant App scope).  

---

## Flows
1. **Intake** — orchestration receives a compiled plan from PHS Control APIs.  
2. **Graph build** — transform the plan into a DAG (directed acyclic graph) of jobs.  
3. **Schedule & execute** — jobs are scheduled with dependencies and resource allocation.  
4. **Handle errors** — retries applied; failed jobs sent to DLQ if thresholds exceeded.  
5. **Report** — execution status sent to Telemetry, lineage metadata sent to Metadata service, and governance visibility provided to Host App.  

---

## Interfaces
- **PHS Control APIs** — supply materialization plans.  
- **Telemetry pipeline** — receives metrics, logs, and traces of job execution.  
- **Lineage & Metadata** — records run details and job-level inputs/outputs.  
- **Host App** — surfaces read-only execution status for governance visibility.  

---

## Why This Matters
Without orchestration, workloads would run in ad-hoc, fragile ways — leading to missed SLAs, inconsistent KPIs, and audit gaps.  
By embedding a centralized orchestration service:
- **Engineers** gain predictable, reliable job execution.  
- **Executives** gain assurance that KPIs are derived from timely, complete data.  
- **Auditors** gain evidence that execution follows approved contracts and is fully traceable.  

The Orchestration & Scheduling service ensures the platform is **reliable, predictable, and auditable**.
