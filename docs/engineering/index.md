# Engineering

## Scope
This section documents how developers build, run, test, release, and operate the BareCount platform.

## Approach
Complete the module documentation first. Populate Engineering after the module pages stabilize. Wire documentation into engineering workflows only when the interfaces and data models are confirmed.

## How we will use this section
- Local Development shows how to set up a workstation and run services.
- Build and Release explains packaging, versioning, and promotion.
- CI/CD defines the pipeline that enforces checks.
- Best Practices collects standards for code, interfaces, and data.
- Roadmap tracks module documentation and wiring status.
- Infrastructure documents provisioning and configuration.
- Testing and Quality defines test levels and quality gates.
- Starter Kits collect runnable examples and templates.
- Runbooks contain operational procedures for incidents and routine tasks.

## When to populate
Populate Engineering when a module has the following in place:
- Data model defined
- Interfaces documented
- Responsibilities and constraints agreed

## Make documentation actionable
- Link migrations from Data Model pages into Build and Release.
- Link API examples from module pages into Starter Kits.
- Convert Runbook steps into tested scripts where possible.
- Add checklists to pull requests to enforce updates to related docs.

## Cross reference
- Modules define the system. Engineering explains how developers execute the work.
- Use precise links to module pages when referring to data models or interfaces.
