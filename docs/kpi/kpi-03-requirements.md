# KPI Services — Requirements

## Purpose
This document specifies the functional and non-functional requirements for KPI Services.  
It defines the expected capabilities, boundaries, and operating conditions.  
These requirements guide design, implementation, and governance decisions.

---

## Functional Requirements
- **KPI Definition Registry**  
  - Store KPI metadata including name, description, owner, and version.  
  - Support lifecycle operations (create, update, deprecate).  

- **Formula Management**  
  - Allow arithmetic, aggregations, and dimensional filters.  
  - Reference GDP entities only; no direct access to Raw contracts.  

- **Validation & Thresholds**  
  - Support rules (range checks, reasonableness tests).  
  - Trigger alerts or actions when thresholds are breached.  

- **Computation & Orchestration**  
  - Schedule recurring computations.  
  - Trigger on demand via APIs.  
  - Persist results with lineage to GDP inputs and KPI version.  

- **Access Control**  
  - Enforce role-based permissions (author, approver, consumer).  

- **Traceability**  
  - Maintain mapping between requirements → design → validation results.  

---

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Availability**: KPI computations and APIs must meet published SLOs.  
- **Scalability**: Support growth in number of KPIs, data volume, and tenants.  
- **Auditability**: Every KPI version and enforcement action must be logged.  
- **Security**: Enforce least-privilege access, encrypted storage, and secure APIs.  
- **Interoperability**: APIs must be ERP/CRM agnostic, accepting GDP contracts as inputs.  
- **Performance**: KPI computation should not materially delay downstream delivery.  

---

## Assumptions
- GDP contracts are always available and validated before KPI execution.  
- Source system schemas will continue to evolve; GDP acts as the stable abstraction layer.  
- Consumers (APIs, reports, downstream apps) will use only KPI contracts, not GDP or Raw directly.  

---

## Constraints
- No direct ingestion of Raw contracts into KPI Services.  
- KPI definitions must reference GDP entities; custom joins or transformations are disallowed at the KPI layer.  
- KPI Services store only metadata and results; no persistence of tenant raw data.  
- Version history is immutable — KPI definitions cannot be modified retroactively.  

---

## Architectural Reference
KPI Services are governed by **ADR-0003: Adopt Three-Contract Model (Raw, GDP, KPI)**.  
This decision enforces strict separation of concerns:  
- Raw contracts capture source schemas.  
- GDP contracts canonicalize into standardized business entities.  
- KPI contracts define metrics and results, derived only from GDP entities.  

---

These requirements form the baseline for design and governance of KPI Services.  
They must be reviewed whenever Schema Services, GDP contracts, or platform SLAs change.
