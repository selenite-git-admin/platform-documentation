# Offerings  

BareCount™ is delivered through modular **Executive Packs** that cover Finance, Sales, Marketing, and Operations. Each pack is built on the EKDF foundation and contract-bound numbers, ensuring trust and auditability across all functions.  

## Flexible Adoption Paths  
- Start with one function to address an immediate pain point.  
- Expand across multiple business domains for enterprise-wide alignment.  
- Go deeper within a function to unlock advanced KPIs, anomaly detection, and compliance use cases.  

Each pack includes:  
- **Pre-defined KPIs** mapped to EKDF.  
- **Contracts** that capture origin, calculation logic, and validation rules.  
- **Action Panel templates** for workflows, anomaly detection, and quality checks.  

This allows organizations to accelerate reporting and decision processes without heavy data engineering projects.
