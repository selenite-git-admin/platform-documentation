# Position  

## Today’s Landscape  

Enterprise data and analytics solutions fall into three broad categories:  

- **Engineering-First Platforms**  
  Designed for data engineers, they offer flexibility but require long projects, specialized skills, and infrastructure before business users see value.  

- **Dashboard-Centric Tools**  
  Provide visualization but remain post-facto, surfacing stale or inconsistent inputs. They prioritize optics over action.  

- **Service-Heavy Builds**  
  Deliver tailored outputs but at high cost, long delivery cycles, and recurring reinvestment to stay relevant.  

These approaches leave enterprises with fragmented numbers, delayed insights, and high ongoing costs.  

## How BareCount™ Solves These Gaps  

- **Simplifying Engineering-First Platforms**  
  EKDF and pre-built KPIs deliver reconciled, governed numbers out of the box. Value is delivered in weeks, not months.  

- **Going Beyond Dashboard-Centric Tools**  
  Real-time ingestion and Action Panels convert numbers from passive reports into active workflows and outcomes.  

- **Eliminating Service-Heavy Builds**  
  Modular KPI packs for Finance, Sales, Marketing, and Operations are pre-built and customizable, removing dependency on external service projects.  

- **Not Reinventing, Not Retrofitting, No New UI**  
  BareCount™ modernizes KPI processes without forcing changes to existing practices or user interfaces. Enterprises keep their tools; BareCount™ improves the numbers behind them.
