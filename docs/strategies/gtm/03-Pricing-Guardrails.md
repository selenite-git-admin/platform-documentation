# Pricing Guardrails

## Purpose
Define pricing boundaries that protect margin while remaining simple and predictable for the customer. Guardrails help sales teams close deals confidently without ad-hoc negotiations.

## Context
BareCount Data Action Platform is positioned as an enterprise platform for mid-market and large enterprises. Pricing must reflect the value of reduced audit risk, faster decision making, and governed KPI delivery. The baseline price point aligns with enterprises that have existing ERP, CRM, and HR systems.

## Outcomes
- Predictable pricing that correlates with enterprise value
- Clear guidance for sales teams to avoid underpricing or overdiscounting
- Transparency for customers with straightforward tiers and add-ons

## Approach
Anchor pricing around subscription tiers with optional usage-based components. Discounts are limited to predefined situations such as multi-year commitments or upfront payments. Free pilots or open-ended proof of concepts are avoided.

## Pricing Structure

### Baseline Subscription
- Entry bracket: two to three lakh INR per month for enterprises running one or two major systems
- Scale brackets: incremental tiers for additional systems, additional tenants, or advanced value packs
- Annual contracts encouraged with quarterly billing options

### Usage Components
- Data processing overages priced per terabyte beyond included quota
- Premium network runners such as site-to-site VPN or private link priced per environment
- Optional advisory or analytics service packs offered as value-added tiers

### Discounts and Terms
- Annual prepay or multi-year commitments unlock negotiated discounts
- No discounts below sustainable delivery cost
- No free pilots; pilots are priced within defined proof-of-value engagements
- Standard contracts used to ensure consistency across customers

## Risks and Considerations
- Avoid complex metering models that confuse customers or create billing anxiety
- Do not discount heavily for small customers outside the Ideal Customer Profile
- Avoid one-off custom pricing structures that are difficult to maintain or explain
- Ensure pricing aligns with the long-term platform subscription model and not one-time project budgets

## Example
A distribution company with 800 crore INR turnover runs SAP and Salesforce. Baseline subscription at three lakh INR per month includes ingestion, schema registry, and KPI packs for finance and sales. An additional premium runner for a private VPN is priced as an add-on. A two-year prepay unlocks a ten percent discount.

## Notes
Pricing should be reviewed annually. Adjust tiers to reflect new connector families, value packs, or cost structures in cloud infrastructure. Always communicate value in terms of risk reduction and time saved.
