# Discovery Questionnaire

## Purpose
Provide a structured set of questions that reveal business goals, data sources, governance constraints, and KPI priorities. A disciplined discovery process ensures that BarceCount Data Action Platform is positioned to deliver value quickly and without scope gaps.

## Context
Discovery is the foundation of every sales cycle and proof of value. A consistent questionnaire reduces cycle time, highlights risks early, and creates a shared record between the sales team and the customer sponsor.

## Organization and Sponsorship
- Who is the executive sponsor
- Who signs off on success
- What budget window and timeframe are we working with?
- Which departments or business units are directly impacted?

## Systems and Data
- Which ERP, CRM, HR, or finance systems are in scope?
- Which databases or third-party platforms hold critical datasets?
- Who owns each system or dataset
- Are there existing integrations or data warehouses in use?

## KPIs and Decisions
- What decisions are delayed due to data availability or quality
- Which KPIs are most critical for the next quarter?
- Which KPIs are owned by the CFO, COO, or CIO?
- How are KPIs currently produced and validated?

## Risk and Compliance
- What regulatory or audit obligations must be satisfied?
- Are there data residency or data protection constraints?
- How is access to sensitive financial or HR data managed?
- Are there ongoing or upcoming audits that affect system access?

## Success Criteria
- What outcomes will prove value within eight weeks
- How will improvement be measured?
- What will trigger a decision to expand to production

## Approach
- Use the questionnaire in the first two meetings with the customer
- Record answers as structured notes in CRM or project tracker
- Confirm with the sponsor that responses are accurate and complete
- Translate discovery answers into POV scope and success criteria

## Example
A manufacturing company identifies that monthly close is delayed by ten days due to manual reconciliation between SAP and Salesforce. KPIs for receivables aging and pipeline conversion are named as priorities. The CFO and CIO sponsor the initiative. Success is defined as reducing the close cycle by three days and proving automated KPI computation.

## Notes
Always ask questions in plain business language. Avoid technical jargon unless the audience is engineering. Discovery is about surfacing pain points, constraints, and priorities, not about proposing solutions.
