# Ideal Customer Profile

## Purpose
Define who benefits most from BareCount Data Action Platform and align marketing, sales, and delivery toward those customers. This reduces wasted cycles and increases win rates.

## Context
BareCount is for organizations operating enterprise systems that need governed, reconciled KPIs and repeatable activations. The Ideal Customer Profile helps qualify prospects early and guides the rest of the GTM playbooks.

## Who is the ideal customer
- Mid to large enterprises with multiple systems of record and many integrations
- Teams that need to reconcile finance, sales, and operations in a single view
- CFO, COO, CIO led initiatives where audit, compliance, and decision time matter
- Engineering bandwidth is limited or locked to core product
- Budgets that support long term platform subscriptions instead of one time projects

## Who is not the ideal customer
- Very small businesses with one accounting package and basic reporting needs
- Tooling buyers that want only a dashboard
- Teams seeking a custom build rather than a platform
- Organizations without owners for finance data or KPI definitions

## Observable signals that increase fit score
- SAP, Microsoft Dynamics, Salesforce, NetSuite, or Workday are in the stack
- Manual reconciliations between finance and CRM
- Delays in monthly close and ad hoc decision-making
- Security review and audit processes already exist
- Appetite for a pilot that proves a measurable outcome

## Disqualifiers
- No executive sponsor with a clear problem and budget window
- Scope is a data warehouse rebuild or a visualization-only request
- Expectation of free pilots without scope or success criteria
- No access to systems needed for reconciliation and KPIs

## Segment notes
Manufacturing, distribution, consumer goods, and business services show strong fit. These industries commonly run SAP or Dynamics and have significant reconciliation needs across order to cash and procure to pay cycles. Financial services may be viable where internal systems expose stable APIs and there is clear sponsorship for risk and compliance metrics.

## Buying roles and motivations
- CFO wants reliable financial truth, audit readiness, and faster close
- COO wants operational visibility and predictable outcomes from process metrics
- CIO wants fewer custom data projects and better governance
- Data owners want simple ways to land and validate system data

## Sales approach at a glance
- Qualify quickly using the ICP and discovery questionnaire
- Propose a proof of value focused on a single process and a few key KPIs
- Use standard connectors or one enterprise connector to reduce risk
- Publish success criteria and dates at the start of the engagement

## Example scenarios
- A company uses SAP for ERP and Salesforce for CRM. The CFO needs reconciled revenue and receivables KPIs. The BareCount platform lands data daily, validates schemas, computes KPIs, and provides alerts and narratives for decision makers.
- A distributor runs Tally for finance and a custom order system. The team wants to reconcile invoices to shipments and collections. The platform uses Tally ingestion and a generic REST connector for the order system, builds KPIs with tests, and reduces manual effort.

## Scope boundaries
The ICP is a guide. Exceptions are allowed with justification. If a company is outside the profile but has similar pains and sponsorship, treat it as a controlled pilot with clear success criteria and exit gates.

## Update cycle
Review this document quarterly. Adjust threshold values such as revenue bands and system lists based on field evidence. Record reasons when deals outside the ICP are pursued or disqualified to improve the profile over time.

## Notes
If you need the image assets and version badges rendered properly, ensure they are available in the docs static assets path.
