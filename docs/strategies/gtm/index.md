# Go-To-Market Strategy

## Purpose
The Go-To-Market (GTM) strategy defines how BareCount Data Action Platform reaches, wins, and grows enterprise customers. It provides a structured framework for sales, marketing, and delivery teams to align their actions around one consistent model.

## Context
BareCount is positioned for mid-market and large enterprises that rely on ERP, CRM, and HR systems. Customers expect reliable KPI governance, reconciliation across systems, and actionable workflows. The GTM strategy addresses how we identify the right customers, run disciplined proofs of value, handle objections, compete effectively, and expand accounts over time.

## Structure of This Section
The GTM strategy is organized into a set of documents. Each document addresses a specific stage or enabler of the go-to-market journey.

### Core Documents
- [Ideal Customer Profile](01-ICP.md)  
- [Discovery Questionnaire](02-Discovery-Questionnaire.md)  
- [Pricing Guardrails](03-Pricing-Guardrails.md)  
- [Objection Handling](04-Objection-Handling.md)  
- [Proof of Value Playbook](05-POV-Playbook.md)  
- [Proof of Value Success Criteria](06-POV-Success-Criteria.md)  
- [Go-To-Market Playbook](07-GTM-Playbook.md)  

### Enablers
- [Partner Strategy](08-Partner-Strategy.md)  
- [Competition Strategy](09-Competition-Strategy.md)  
- [Sales Process](10-Sales-Process.md)  

### Growth
- [Expansion Playbook](11-Expansion-Playbook.md)  
- [Traps to Avoid](12-Traps-to-Avoid.md)  

## Usage
- Sales teams use this section to qualify, execute, and expand deals.  
- Marketing teams use ICP and objection handling inputs for campaigns.  
- Delivery teams use POV playbooks and success criteria to guide execution.  
- Leadership reviews GTM strategy quarterly and adjusts based on market feedback and win-loss analysis.

## Notes
All GTM documents are living references. They should be reviewed and updated regularly as market conditions change and as BareCount expands its platform capabilities.
