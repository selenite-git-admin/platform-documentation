# Proof of Value Success Criteria

## Purpose
Define measurable outcomes that determine whether a proof of value (POV) is successful. Success criteria provide clarity for both the customer and the BareCount team, ensuring alignment before the engagement begins.

## Context
A POV is only meaningful if success can be proven objectively. Success criteria create a shared understanding with the sponsor and prevent scope creep. They also provide evidence for subscription decisions and build confidence in platform adoption.

## Approach
- Define no more than three to five criteria for each POV
- Criteria must be measurable within the duration of the POV
- Criteria should reflect outcomes, not tasks
- Criteria should be documented and signed off by the sponsor before execution begins

## Examples of Success Criteria

### Data Ingestion
- Data from SAP and Salesforce is ingested daily into the platform
- Data latency is reduced from weekly manual uploads to daily automated runs
- Schema validation ensures 100 percent alignment with system of record fields

### KPI Accuracy
- Days sales outstanding KPI matches within two percent of system of record
- Revenue recognition KPI computed within one day of period close
- Reconciliation between finance and CRM data reduces variance to less than five percent

### Process Improvement
- Monthly close cycle reduced by three days
- Manual reconciliation effort reduced by fifty percent
- Audit queries resolved in one day instead of one week

### Activation
- Automated alerts generated for overdue receivables above threshold
- Narrative reporting available for top three KPIs
- Anomaly detection applied to one finance process

## Execution Notes
- Document baseline measurements before starting POV
- Validate KPI computations against the system of record with customer team
- Present results in a simple before-and-after view
- Use quantitative evidence wherever possible; qualitative feedback may supplement but not replace metrics

## Risks
- Overly complex success criteria that cannot be achieved in eight weeks
- Criteria based on subjective perception rather than measurable outcomes
- Lack of alignment between sponsor and project team

## Example
For a manufacturing company, the POV scope is a receivable reconciliation. Success criteria are: (1) daily automated ingestion from SAP and Salesforce, (2) DSO KPI variance less than two percent, and (3) reduction of reconciliation effort from ten hours per week to five. All three criteria are achieved, leading to subscription approval.

## Notes
Success criteria should be reviewed at the midpoint of the POV to ensure progress is on track. If adjustments are needed, they must be documented and agreed with the sponsor.
