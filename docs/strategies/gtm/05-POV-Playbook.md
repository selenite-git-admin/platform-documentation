# Proof of Value Playbook

## Purpose
Define a repeatable program that demonstrates measurable value with limited risk. The proof of value (POV) shows customers the outcomes BareCount Data Action Platform can deliver in weeks rather than months.

## Context
Enterprises often hesitate to commit to a new platform without evidence of success. A structured POV addresses this by focusing on a narrow scope, delivering outcomes quickly, and establishing trust. The POV builds confidence for subscription decisions and accelerates time to production.

## Outcomes
- A documented baseline of current state
- A measurable improvement in time, accuracy, or compliance
- Sponsor validation that the platform delivers business value
- A decision on production rollout

## Approach
The POV should be designed for a duration of eight weeks or less. Scope is limited to one business process and one or two systems of record. Standard connectors are prioritized to reduce complexity. Success criteria are published at the start and agreed upon with the sponsor.

## Execution Steps

### Week 1 to 2: Discovery and Access
- Confirm business sponsor and decision makers
- Validate discovery questionnaire responses
- Secure access approvals for source systems
- Prepare POV project tracker with success criteria

### Week 3 to 4: Data Landing
- Land data into Bronze and Silver layers
- Validate schemas against system of record
- Register data in schema registry

### Week 5 to 6: KPI Computation
- Define priority KPIs from finance, sales, or operations
- Compute KPIs using GDP tables and apply validation checks
- Compare KPI results with system of record to ensure accuracy

### Week 7: Activation
- Enable one activation workflow such as alerts, anomaly detection, or narrative reporting
- Demonstrate value of KPI activation beyond dashboards

### Week 8: Review and Decision
- Review results with sponsor
- Compare metrics against success criteria
- Prepare executive summary and recommendation for production rollout

## Example
A logistics company runs SAP and Salesforce. The POV focuses on order-to-cash reconciliation and days sales outstanding. Within six weeks, BareCount computes reconciled KPIs validated to within two percent of the system of record. The CFO approves expansion to production.

## Metrics
- Time to first data landed
- Number of KPIs validated
- Variance between KPI values and system of record
- Time saved in decision making or reconciliation

## Notes
- Keep scope small to guarantee quick wins
- Avoid custom work during POV; use standard platform capabilities
- Always document results in a one-page executive summary
