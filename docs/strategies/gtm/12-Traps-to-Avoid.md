# Traps to Avoid

## Purpose
Highlight common pitfalls that can derail sales, proofs of value, or expansion. By learning from past experiences, BareCount Data Action Platform teams can avoid repeating costly mistakes.

## Context
The enterprise data market is filled with complex projects, unclear expectations, and mismatched customers. Traps emerge when teams deviate from the playbooks or chase opportunities outside the Ideal Customer Profile. Documenting these traps helps maintain discipline and protect margin.

## Traps

### Free Pilots
Running unpaid pilots consumes resources without guarantee of conversion. Customers who demand free pilots often lack commitment or budget.

**Avoidance:** Always price proofs of value within clear scope. Use success criteria to prove value.

### Over-Customization
Building custom features during POVs or early rollouts creates technical debt and undermines the platform model.

**Avoidance:** Use only standard connectors and KPI packs during POV. Reserve custom work for later stages after contract expansion.

### Chasing Poor Fit Customers
SMEs or customers with only basic reporting needs cannot justify enterprise subscription costs.

**Avoidance:** Qualify strictly with the ICP. Disqualify early if signals are weak.

### Scope Creep
Allowing additional KPIs, systems, or processes into POV without revisiting timelines or pricing creates delays and frustration.

**Avoidance:** Document scope clearly at the start. Any change requires sponsor approval and adjustment.

### Competing on Price
Discounting heavily to win deals erodes margin and positions BareCount as a commodity.

**Avoidance:** Anchor conversations on outcomes, risk reduction, and executive time saved. Use pricing guardrails.

### Neglecting Security and Compliance
Skipping security reviews or underestimating compliance requirements can halt rollouts.

**Avoidance:** Provide compliance documentation early. Offer narrow pilots while full reviews progress.

### Weak Documentation
Failure to document discovery answers, POV success criteria, or expansion results undermines trust and slows decision making.

**Avoidance:** Record everything in CRM and project trackers. Publish executive summaries at each stage.

### Ignoring Expansion
Stopping at the POV or first rollout limits customer value and revenue potential.

**Avoidance:** Use the expansion playbook. Always plan next steps during quarterly reviews.

## Example
A services firm pursued a deal with a small business outside the ICP. A free pilot was run, scope was extended multiple times, and after three months no subscription was signed. Resources were wasted and credibility was impacted. In contrast, disciplined application of the playbooks converts enterprise accounts within eight weeks.

## Notes
This document should be reviewed quarterly and updated with new traps observed in the field. Use win-loss reviews and retrospectives to refine the list.
