# Expansion Playbook

## Purpose
Provide a structured approach to grow customer accounts after the initial proof of value (POV). Expansion ensures that BareCount Data Action Platform moves from solving one problem to becoming a strategic platform for the enterprise.

## Context
Most enterprises begin with a narrow scope, such as finance KPIs or reconciliation between two systems. Once value is proven, expansion opportunities arise across additional processes, systems, and business units. A playbook ensures consistent growth and maximizes customer lifetime value.

## Objectives
- Expand from single-process to multi-domain adoption
- Increase subscription value by adding connectors and KPI packs
- Position BareCount as a long-term strategic platform
- Improve retention by embedding the platform deeper into enterprise processes

## Expansion Stages

### 1. Baseline
- Confirm success of POV
- Document results and ROI
- Secure sponsor testimonial

### 2. Adjacent Expansion
- Identify next process in the same department (for example, moving from receivables to payables in finance)
- Propose add-on KPI packs or connectors
- Use quick wins to build momentum

### 3. Cross-Department Expansion
- Engage sponsors in other departments (for example, COO or CIO)
- Run discovery and small-scale POVs in new domains
- Position BareCount as the cross-functional KPI platform

### 4. Enterprise Expansion
- Standardize KPI governance across all departments
- Offer value packs such as advisory or analytics as a service
- Propose enterprise-wide contracts with multi-year commitments

## Levers for Expansion
- Additional enterprise connectors (for example, adding Workday or NetSuite)
- KPI packs beyond finance (for example, sales pipeline, supply chain, HR)
- Premium deployment options such as private link or dedicated runners
- Analytics and advisory value packs

## Example
A manufacturing enterprise starts with a CFO-sponsored POV on receivables. After success, BareCount expands into payables KPIs. The COO then sponsors a supply chain module for on-time delivery KPIs. Within eighteen months, the subscription grows from three lakh to ten lakh per month.

## Risks
- Expansion without confirming initial success may backfire
- Over-promising new capabilities before they are mature
- Lack of executive sponsorship in new departments

## Metrics
- Net revenue retention
- Average subscription growth per customer
- Number of connectors and KPI packs adopted
- Number of departments using BareCount

## Notes
Expansion opportunities should be logged in CRM. Success stories should be published as case studies to fuel further growth. Expansion playbook should be reviewed quarterly and adjusted based on customer adoption trends.
