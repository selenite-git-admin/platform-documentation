# Objection Handling

## Purpose
Provide structured responses to common objections encountered during the sales cycle. Objection handling reduces friction, builds trust, and moves the prospect toward a decision.

## Context
BareCount Data Action Platform addresses enterprise problems of governance, reconciliation, and KPI activation. Prospects often raise objections around price, timing, security, or integration. Preparing answers in advance ensures the sales team responds confidently and consistently.

## Approach
- Acknowledge the concern clearly to show empathy
- Restate the objective or problem the customer wants solved
- Present an option backed by evidence or reference material
- Propose a concrete next step that lowers perceived risk

## Common Objections and Responses

### Price is high
- Acknowledge: Pricing is a significant consideration
- Restate: The objective is to reduce audit risk, close cycles faster, and save executive hours
- Response: The monthly cost is a fraction of the cost of additional finance headcount or audit exposure
- Next step: Run a proof of value to measure the time and risk savings directly

### Security review is long
- Acknowledge: Security processes are critical for enterprise adoption
- Restate: The objective is to run a safe and compliant trial
- Response: Provide the security and compliance packet with certifications, RBAC model, and audit trail examples
- Next step: Offer a narrow-scoped pilot in a controlled environment while the full review proceeds

### Integration risk
- Acknowledge: Integrations are often where projects fail
- Restate: The objective is to connect quickly without disruption
- Response: BareCount uses standard connectors and proven patterns. Start with one connector and validate KPIs against the system of record
- Next step: Run an initial ingestion with non-critical data before scaling to full production

### We already have dashboards
- Acknowledge: Dashboards exist in many organizations
- Restate: The issue is not visualization, but reliability and governance of the numbers
- Response: BareCount delivers validated KPIs, audit trails, and activation workflows that go beyond dashboards
- Next step: Compare one finance KPI from current dashboards with BareCount KPI packs to highlight reliability gains

## Notes
- Log objections in CRM with details of the prospect and context
- Update objection handling notes quarterly based on win-loss reviews
- Train sales teams using role plays with the top five objections
- Keep answers concise, factual, and oriented toward outcomes
