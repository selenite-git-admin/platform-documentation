# Partner Strategy

## Purpose
Define how BareCount Data Action Platform engages with partners to expand market reach, accelerate adoption, and deliver customer value. Partnerships extend the sales and delivery capacity beyond the core team.

## Context
Mid-market and large enterprises often prefer working with trusted partners. A partner ecosystem provides coverage across industries and geographies, ensures integration with customer-preferred vendors, and helps scale faster. BareCount must selectively engage with partners who align with its positioning and value proposition.

## Objectives
- Build credibility by associating with established technology and consulting partners
- Accelerate deal flow through referrals and co-sell motions
- Extend implementation and support capacity through trained partner teams
- Position BareCount as a platform within partner ecosystems

## Partner Types

### Technology Partners
- ERP, CRM, and HR system vendors such as SAP, Microsoft, and Salesforce
- Cloud providers such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud
- API and integration platforms
- Security and compliance tool vendors

### Consulting Partners
- Regional system integrators with ERP and CRM experience
- Niche consulting firms focused on finance transformation
- Audit and compliance firms that emphasize KPI governance
- Boutique advisory firms with strong CFO relationships

### Channel and Resellers
- Local partners in markets where BareCount has no direct presence
- Resellers with established finance and operations customer bases
- Managed service providers who can embed BareCount as part of a larger service stack

## Engagement Models
- Referral: Partners identify opportunities and pass them to BareCount sales
- Co-sell: Joint pursuit with aligned account strategy
- Resell: Partners sell BareCount under their own contracts
- Delivery: Partners trained to implement and support BareCount

## Partner Enablement
- Provide training modules, reference architectures, and playbooks
- Offer partner sandbox environments
- Publish connectors roadmap for partner alignment
- Certify partner teams to deliver POVs and production rollouts

## Risks
- Over-reliance on partners without building direct customer relationships
- Dilution of positioning if partners treat BareCount as a commodity tool
- Channel conflict between direct sales and partners

## Example
A regional SAP integrator in India partners with BareCount to deliver CFO-focused KPI packs. BareCount provides the platform and training while the partner handles local discovery and implementation. The integrator earns margin on subscription and services while BareCount gains access to new customers.

## Notes
Partner strategy should be reviewed bi-annually. Add partners selectively, focusing on quality over quantity. Measure partner contribution to pipeline, deal closures, and customer satisfaction.
