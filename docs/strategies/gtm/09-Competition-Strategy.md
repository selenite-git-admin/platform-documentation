# Competition Strategy

## Purpose
Define how BareCount Data Action Platform positions itself against competitors. A clear competition strategy ensures that sales teams know when to engage, how to differentiate, and how to win.

## Context
The enterprise data and analytics market is crowded with BI tools, ETL vendors, and custom services firms. BareCount is not another visualization tool or generic pipeline product. It is a data action platform that provides reconciled KPIs, governed processes, and activation workflows. Competition strategy must make this distinction explicit.

## Objectives
- Position BareCount as a category distinct from BI and ETL tools
- Neutralize objections about build versus buy
- Highlight differentiators such as connectors, KPI packs, and governance
- Equip sales teams with competitive talk tracks

## Competitor Categories

### Business Intelligence Tools
Examples: Power BI, Tableau, Qlik  
Positioning: BI tools visualize data but do not solve reconciliation, governance, or activation. BareCount can feed validated KPIs into BI tools, making them more reliable.

### ETL and Data Pipeline Tools
Examples: Talend, Informatica, Fivetran, Airbyte  
Positioning: These tools move data but leave governance, KPI definitions, and activation to the customer. BareCount delivers outcomes by integrating ingestion, KPI packs, and actions.

### ERP and CRM Native Tools
Examples: SAP Analytics Cloud, Salesforce Tableau CRM  
Positioning: Native tools cover one system only. BareCount reconciles across systems and domains to deliver enterprise-wide KPIs.

### Custom Data Projects
Examples: In-house data warehouse builds, bespoke consulting projects  
Positioning: Custom builds are slow, costly, and fragile. BareCount provides reusable connectors, KPI packs, and a governed platform that accelerates outcomes.

## Differentiators
- Out-of-the-box enterprise connectors
- Predefined Golden Data Points and KPI packs
- Governance with schema registry and audit trails
- Activation workflows that go beyond dashboards
- Faster time to value compared to custom builds

## Sales Talk Tracks
- "We are not another BI tool. We make BI better by providing governed KPIs."
- "We are not an ETL vendor. We deliver outcomes, not just pipelines."
- "We are not limited to one ERP or CRM. We reconcile across systems."
- "We are not a services firm. We are a platform that scales."

## Risks
- Competitors may undercut pricing to protect accounts
- Customers may underestimate complexity and choose BI or ETL tools
- Services firms may position BareCount as overlapping with their offerings

## Example
In a competitive deal, a customer considers building pipelines with Informatica and visualizing with Power BI. BareCount positions itself as the faster, governed path to reconciled KPIs. By running a POV in eight weeks, BareCount proves outcomes while the build-versus-buy debate is still ongoing.

## Notes
Competition strategy should be updated quarterly based on win-loss reviews. Capture competitor talk tracks and update positioning accordingly.
