# Go-To-Market Playbook

## Purpose
Provide a structured approach for taking BareCount Data Action Platform to market. The playbook guides sales, marketing, and delivery teams through the steps required to win customers consistently.

## Context
BareCount is positioned as an enterprise-grade platform for mid-market and large enterprises. The go-to-market (GTM) strategy must focus on segments that value reconciled KPIs, governance, and rapid activation. The playbook helps align teams and ensures repeatable motions.

## Objectives
- Establish BareCount as the trusted platform for finance, sales, and operations KPIs
- Land first with CFO-sponsored initiatives and expand to COO and CIO domains
- Shorten sales cycles by using ICP, discovery questionnaire, and POV playbook
- Create a predictable pipeline with a clear qualification and execution process

## GTM Stages

### 1. Awareness
- Targeted content for CFO, COO, and CIO personas
- Case studies and whitepapers on reconciliation and audit readiness
- Webinars and industry events focused on KPI governance
- Partnerships with ERP and CRM ecosystem vendors

### 2. Discovery
- Use the discovery questionnaire to qualify prospects
- Identify system landscape and sponsor ownership
- Confirm the budget window and decision process
- Log details in CRM for consistency across a sales team

### 3. Proof of Value
- Run scoped POVs as per playbook
- Publish success criteria upfront
- Deliver results within eight weeks
- Document metrics and executive summary

### 4. Expansion
- Move from single-process POV to multi-domain rollout
- Upsell additional connectors and value packs
- Position advisory and analytics services
- Establish long-term subscription contracts

### 5. Retention
- Ensure quarterly business reviews with sponsors
- Track KPI improvements and ROI metrics
- Publish roadmap of new connectors and features
- Use customer references to strengthen credibility

## Key Metrics
- Pipeline coverage versus revenue targets
- POV win rate and conversion to production
- Average deal size and subscription term
- Customer retention and expansion rate

## Example Scenario
A distribution company starts with a CFO-sponsored POV on receivables reconciliation. After proving value, BareCount expands to sales pipeline KPIs for the CGO and later to supply chain KPIs for the COO. Subscription grows from three lakh per month to seven lakh per month over eighteen months.

## Notes
The GTM playbook should be updated quarterly based on field evidence. Incorporate lessons learned from wins and losses to refine qualification, messaging, and expansion tactics.
