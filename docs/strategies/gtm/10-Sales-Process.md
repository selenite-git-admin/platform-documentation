# Sales Process

## Purpose
Provide a structured and repeatable process for selling BareCount Data Action Platform. The sales process ensures consistent qualification, execution, and closure across opportunities.

## Context
Enterprise sales cycles are complex, with multiple stakeholders and long decision timelines. A disciplined process reduces risk, accelerates cycle times, and improves conversion rates. BareCount’s sales process is designed around discovery, proof of value, and subscription expansion.

## Objectives
- Qualify opportunities early using the Ideal Customer Profile
- Reduce wasted cycles by disqualifying mismatched prospects
- Run efficient proofs of value with measurable outcomes
- Expand from single-process POV to full platform adoption

## Sales Stages

### 1. Qualification
- Use the discovery questionnaire
- Confirm executive sponsorship
- Validate budget and decision window
- Log opportunity in CRM with ICP alignment

### 2. Discovery
- Map systems of record (ERP, CRM, HR, Finance)
- Identify priority KPIs and pain points
- Confirm governance and compliance requirements
- Document initial success criteria with sponsor

### 3. Proof of Value
- Define scope and timeline (≤ 8 weeks)
- Publish success criteria
- Execute standard POV playbook
- Document before-and-after outcomes

### 4. Proposal
- Present subscription pricing aligned to platform value
- Include add-ons such as premium runners or advisory packs
- Position long-term contract value
- Provide case studies and reference architectures

### 5. Negotiation
- Apply pricing guardrails
- Offer discounts only for multi-year or upfront commitments
- Avoid custom contract structures
- Align contract terms with delivery capacity

### 6. Close
- Confirm sponsor approval
- Execute subscription contract
- Prepare onboarding plan for production rollout
- Record lessons learned in CRM

## Sales Aids
- ICP document and fit scorecard
- Discovery questionnaire template
- POV playbook and success criteria examples
- Objection handling guide
- Pricing guardrails document
- Competition strategy notes

## Metrics
- Lead-to-opportunity conversion rate
- POV-to-subscription conversion rate
- Average deal size and subscription term
- Win rate against competitors
- Sales cycle length

## Example
A sales team engages a consumer goods enterprise. After qualification, they run a POV focused on receivables KPIs. The POV proves value within six weeks. A subscription proposal is made with baseline pricing and an add-on for premium VPN runner. The deal closes with a two-year contract.

## Notes
The sales process should be reviewed semi-annually. Field teams must log deviations from the process in CRM to refine best practices.
