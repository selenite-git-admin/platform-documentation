# Customer Interaction Red Flags

## Purpose
Identify signals in early customer interactions that indicate risk for BareCount Data Action Platform. Recognizing these red flags early allows the team to qualify or disqualify opportunities before committing time and resources.

## Context
Enterprise customers often start engagement with exploratory conversations. These interactions reveal intent, maturity, and sponsorship. Failing to identify early warning signs can lead to wasted sales cycles, misaligned expectations, and reputational risk.

## Common Red Flags

### No Clear Sponsor
- Meetings are attended only by junior staff or consultants
- No executive sponsor is identified
- Decisions appear to be deferred to a committee without authority

### Budget Ambiguity
- Customer cannot specify a budget window
- Requests for free pilots or unpaid proofs of concept
- References to "exploring options" without clear investment intent

### Vague Problem Definition
- Customer cannot articulate business outcomes they want
- Focus is on technology curiosity rather than solving a pain point
- Multiple shifting priorities with no clear anchor KPI

### Unrealistic Expectations
- Requests for end-to-end transformation in short timelines
- Expectation that BareCount will replace existing ERP or CRM entirely
- Requests for features outside the platform scope during early conversations

### Lack of System Access
- Customer is unwilling to discuss current ERP, CRM, or HR systems
- IT team resists providing data access even for scoped POVs
- Unclear ownership of system data

## Mitigation Actions
- Ask directly about sponsor, budget, and timeline
- Use the discovery questionnaire to document responses
- Reframe vague requirements into concrete KPI-driven outcomes
- Position POV as a priced engagement with defined criteria
- Escalate to sales leadership if engagement lacks a clear path forward

## Example
During an early call, a customer repeatedly requests a free trial with no mention of sponsorship or budget. The team documents this as a red flag and pauses pursuit until a CFO sponsor and budget owner are confirmed.

## Notes
Red flags should not automatically disqualify a customer. Instead, they should trigger structured follow-ups, clarifying questions, and qualification steps. If red flags persist without resolution, the opportunity should be marked as high risk in CRM.
