# Security and Compliance Red Flags

## Purpose
Identify risks related to security and compliance during sales, onboarding, and delivery of BareCount Data Action Platform. These red flags, if ignored, can block deals, delay rollouts, or create reputational damage.

## Context
Enterprise customers hold BareCount to high security and compliance standards. Data governance, regulatory frameworks, and IT security processes must be respected. A weak security posture or missed compliance step can derail adoption, even if the platform delivers value technically.

## Common Red Flags

### Lack of Security Readiness
- Customer asks for certifications or security documentation that is unavailable
- Responses to questionnaires are delayed or incomplete
- No internal ownership for security reviews within BareCount

### Customer Resistance
- Prospect unwilling to provide required access due to perceived risk
- Security team refuses to approve SaaS deployment without proof of controls
- Overemphasis on compliance paperwork without discussion of outcomes

### Compliance Gaps
- No documented data retention and deletion policy
- Absence of audit trails for KPI changes and actions
- Encryption or key management not demonstrated clearly
- Data residency requirements unclear or unmet

### Weak Governance
- No assigned security owner within BareCount
- Customer compliance concerns escalated informally without process
- Security risks treated as technical issues rather than business blockers

## Mitigation Actions
- Maintain an up-to-date security and compliance packet with certifications, RBAC details, and architecture diagrams
- Provide narrow pilot environments to reduce customer exposure during review
- Assign a dedicated security owner to track and close compliance requests
- Document audit, retention, and data protection policies clearly
- Escalate blockers quickly to sponsor and leadership to avoid deadlocks

## Example
During a POV, a customer security team requested proof of encryption at rest and in transit. BareCount provided architecture diagrams, cloud compliance certifications, and an RBAC demonstration. The request was closed within one week, preventing delays in onboarding.

## Notes
Security and compliance red flags should be logged separately from technical issues. Every enterprise deal will involve scrutiny; readiness and speed of response often determine whether a deal proceeds or stalls.
