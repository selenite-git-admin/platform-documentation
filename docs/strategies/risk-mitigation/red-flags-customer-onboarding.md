# Customer Onboarding Red Flags

## Purpose
Identify risks that surface during the onboarding stage of new customers. Onboarding is the transition from sales commitment to delivery. Red flags at this stage can cause loss of trust, delayed value, or failed rollouts.

## Context
Onboarding sets the tone for the customer relationship. It includes provisioning access, configuring connectors, aligning governance, and launching first use cases. A weak onboarding experience is difficult to recover from, even if the platform later delivers value. The goal is to manage expectations, highlight risks, and keep outcomes on track.

## Common Red Flags

### Missing Sponsor Engagement
- Executive sponsor from the sales cycle does not attend kickoff
- Responsibility is handed off to junior staff without authority
- Sponsor unresponsive to decisions on scope or priorities

### Incomplete Access
- IT teams delay or block system access approvals
- Security reviews stall with no clear owner or timeline
- Customer is unwilling to provide production data even in controlled environments

### Scope Drift
- New KPIs or processes requested outside the agreed scope
- Multiple stakeholders pushing conflicting priorities
- Pressure to expand POV into production without governance in place

### Unrealistic Timelines
- Expectation that onboarding can be completed in days
- Demands for immediate dashboards without ingestion or KPI validation
- Deadlines tied to external events without feasibility assessment

### Poor Data Ownership
- No clear data owner for finance, sales, or HR domains
- Data quality issues dismissed as “not our responsibility”
- Lack of internal alignment on KPI definitions

## Mitigation Actions
- Confirm sponsor participation in a kickoff meeting
- Document required access approvals and secure them early
- Use signed POV or contract scope to prevent drift
- Set realistic timelines and publish onboarding milestones
- Assign data owners explicitly for each system or KPI

## Example
A customer signs for a finance POV but the sponsor does not attend kickoff. The IT team blocks SAP access citing unclear approval. The onboarding team escalates to the CFO sponsor, who confirms ownership and assigns an IT lead. The access issue is resolved within a week, keeping the project on track.

## Notes
Onboarding red flags must be documented in the project tracker. Weekly check-ins should highlight unresolved items and escalate as needed. Strong onboarding discipline reduces downstream risks in delivery and expansion.
