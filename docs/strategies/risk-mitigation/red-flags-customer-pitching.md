# Customer Pitching Red Flags

## Purpose
Highlight risks that arise during customer presentations, demos, and pitches for BareCount Data Action Platform. Early detection of these signals helps sales teams adjust messaging, set expectations, or disengage when necessary.

## Context
Pitching is often the first formal step in presenting BareCount’s value. This is where customer perceptions, expectations, and objections begin to crystallize. If unmanaged, misaligned pitches can lead to long sales cycles, poor fit customers, or scope conflicts later.

## Common Red Flags

### Misaligned Audience
- Presentation attendees are not decision makers
- Sessions dominated by external consultants instead of executives
- No participation from finance, operations, or IT leadership

### Feature Shopping
- Customer focuses on flashy features or dashboard visuals
- Repeated requests for non-core functionality unrelated to KPIs
- Benchmarking BareCount against BI tools without acknowledging governance value

### Unrealistic Comparisons
- Comparing BareCount directly with free or low-cost tools
- Expectation that the platform can be deployed without data ownership or governance
- Requests for immediate proof of all connectors regardless of scope

### Lack of Engagement
- Attendees disengage, multitask, or fail to ask questions
- No discussion of KPIs or outcomes, only high-level curiosity
- Vague statements such as “we will evaluate internally” with no next step

### Price Sensitivity
- Objections to pricing before value is understood
- Demands for pilots without payment or predefined success criteria
- Requests for “discount first, details later”

## Mitigation Actions
- Qualify audience before pitching; confirm executive sponsor attendance
- Anchor pitch around outcomes and KPIs, not technology demos
- Emphasize differentiation from BI or ETL tools with case examples
- Set expectations for paid POVs with defined criteria
- Redirect off-topic feature requests toward roadmap or advisory packs

## Example
In a pitch with a consumer goods company, the CIO sends junior staff only. The team asks follow-up questions and confirms that the CFO has not been involved. Rather than demoing dashboards, BareCount reschedules a focused session with the CFO and finance leads to align on KPIs.

## Notes
Pitching red flags often signal deeper issues in sponsorship or qualification. Document all red flags in CRM and align internally before proceeding. A misaligned pitch is better paused than allowed to create false expectations.
