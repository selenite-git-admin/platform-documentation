# Risk Mitigation Strategy

## Purpose
Define a structured approach for identifying, documenting, and mitigating risks across customer engagements, product development, legal, and partner activities for BareCount Data Action Platform. This section equips teams to recognize red flags early and respond with discipline.

## Context
BareCount engages enterprise customers in complex environments involving finance, operations, and compliance systems. Risks appear at every stageâ€”from first interaction to long-term support. Without a common framework, teams may overlook signals or treat risks informally. This library provides clear guidance to protect outcomes, margin, and reputation.

## Structure of This Section
The Risk Mitigation strategy is organized into red flag guides. Each document addresses one domain where risks commonly arise.

### Customer-Related
- [Customer Interaction Red Flags](red-flags-customer-interaction.md)  
- [Customer Pitching Red Flags](red-flags-customer-pitching.md)  
- [Customer Onboarding Red Flags](red-flags-customer-onboarding.md)  

### Data and Implementation
- [Data Contracts and Data Quality Red Flags](red-flags-data-contracts-quality.md)  
- [Implementation and Governance Red Flags](red-flags-implementation-governance.md)  

### Commercial and Legal
- [Pricing and Commercial Red Flags](red-flags-pricing-commercial.md)  
- [Legal and IP Red Flags](red-flags-legal-ip.md)  

### Product and Roadmap
- [Product Development Red Flags](red-flags-product-development.md)  
- [Product Vision and Roadmap Red Flags](red-flags-product-vision.md)  

### Security and Operations
- [Security and Compliance Red Flags](red-flags-security-compliance.md)  
- [Support and SLAs Red Flags](red-flags-support-slas.md)  

### Ecosystem
- [Vendor and Partner Red Flags](red-flags-vendor-partner.md)  

## Operating Model
- Assign ownership for each risk category during sales, delivery, or product reviews  
- Run checklists from red flag guides as part of qualification, onboarding, and governance forums  
- Log risks in a shared tracker with context, owners, and due dates  
- Escalate unresolved risks to leadership through defined paths  

## Metrics
- Number of risks identified per stage  
- Percentage of risks mitigated before stage gate sign-off  
- Incidents linked to ignored or mishandled red flags  
- Time to resolution for critical risks  

## Governance and Cadence
- Weekly review of open risks by project or sales teams  
- Monthly leadership summary highlighting trends  
- Quarterly updates to red flag guides based on lessons learned  

## Notes
This section is a living library. Teams should contribute updates based on real-world cases. When new risks are identified, document them in the closest existing category or create a proposal for a new red flag guide.
