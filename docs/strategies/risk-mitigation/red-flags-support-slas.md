# Support and SLAs Red Flags

## Purpose
Identify risks related to support and service level agreements (SLAs) for BareCount Data Action Platform. Poorly defined or unrealistic expectations around support can create dissatisfaction, missed renewals, and escalations.

## Context
Support and SLAs define how BareCount engages with customers after deployment. Enterprises expect reliability, predictable response times, and clear escalation paths. Without clarity, customers may assume guarantees that BareCount cannot fulfill, or they may undervalue standard support tiers.

## Common Red Flags

### Undefined Expectations
- Customer assumes 24x7 support without it being in the contract
- SLAs not discussed during sales cycle
- Prospect expects support for third-party systems outside BareCount’s scope

### Overcommitment
- Sales promises resolution times faster than the support team can deliver
- Commitments made for “always on” or “zero downtime” without proper architecture
- Free pilots treated as if full SLAs apply

### Weak Processes
- No defined escalation paths for critical issues
- Lack of clear ownership between BareCount and customer IT
- Support tickets bypassed through informal channels

### Resource Gaps
- Customer lacks internal support team to handle first-level triage
- Dependence on one BareCount engineer for all support
- No documentation or knowledge base provided to reduce repetitive queries

## Mitigation Actions
- Define support tiers and SLA options in contracts before deployment
- Align promises with delivery capacity and infrastructure design
- Publish clear escalation paths and response time commitments
- Provide onboarding documentation and a customer knowledge base
- Require customer to assign internal IT contacts for triage

## Example
A manufacturing customer assumed BareCount would provide 24x7 coverage. During contract negotiation, this was flagged as a red flag. The sales team clarified support tiers and offered premium SLA as an add-on. The expectation was reset, and the deal closed without hidden risk.

## Notes
Support and SLA red flags should be documented in CRM and contracts. Any deviation from standard SLAs must be approved by leadership. Discipline in managing expectations prevents friction later in the customer lifecycle.
