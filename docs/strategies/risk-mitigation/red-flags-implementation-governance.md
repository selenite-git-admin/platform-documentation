# Implementation and Governance Red Flags

## Purpose
Identify risks that arise during implementation and governance of BareCount Data Action Platform. Clear governance ensures delivery discipline, prevents scope creep, and aligns stakeholders on decisions.

## Context
Enterprise implementations involve multiple teams, systems, and processes. Without governance, projects can lose direction, expand uncontrollably, or stall due to indecision. BareCount requires structured governance to protect delivery timelines and ensure adoption.

## Common Red Flags

### Weak Governance Structures
- No steering committee or governance forum established
- Lack of clarity on roles and responsibilities across IT and business
- Decisions delayed because no single owner has authority

### Scope Creep
- Requests to add new systems, KPIs, or workflows without formal change control
- Stakeholders pressuring delivery teams to bypass scope boundaries
- POVs evolving into production rollouts without approvals

### Misaligned Expectations
- Customer assumes BareCount will replace ERP, CRM, or BI systems
- Over-reliance on dashboards instead of focusing on KPI governance
- Requests for custom development during POV or onboarding

### Resource Gaps
- Customer fails to assign dedicated SMEs or data owners
- No IT resources available for access, approvals, or infrastructure
- Frequent turnover in customer project team

### Governance Fatigue
- Steering meetings skipped or poorly attended
- Decisions deferred repeatedly without resolution
- Lack of executive presence in critical reviews

## Mitigation Actions
- Establish governance charter with steering committee at kickoff
- Document scope in contract and enforce change control
- Publish RACI matrix covering roles and responsibilities
- Escalate scope creep or indecision to executive sponsor
- Require dedicated SMEs and project resources as contract condition

## Example
In an implementation with a distribution enterprise, scope creep emerged when business stakeholders requested new sales KPIs mid-POV. The delivery team flagged this as a red flag, escalated to governance, and realigned scope to focus on the original finance KPIs. Expansion was deferred to post-POV phase.

## Notes
Implementation and governance risks should be tracked in weekly status reports. Strong governance is a non-negotiable requirement for enterprise delivery. Without it, customer trust and project outcomes are at risk.
