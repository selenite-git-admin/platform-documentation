# Product Vision and Roadmap Red Flags

## Purpose
Identify risks that threaten the clarity and execution of BareCount Data Action Platformâ€™s product vision. Red flags in product vision lead to fragmented messaging, confused customers, and diluted execution.

## Context
BareCount differentiates itself through governed KPIs, enterprise connectors, and activation workflows. A strong product vision keeps the company aligned and prevents distractions. Weak vision or roadmap drift creates inconsistent execution, lost credibility, and wasted investment.

## Common Red Flags

### Lack of Clear Positioning
- Teams describe BareCount differently depending on audience
- Messaging shifts between BI, ETL, and ERP replacement without consistency
- Sales teams use custom slides instead of a unified platform narrative

### Roadmap Misalignment
- Features added that do not align with KPI-first philosophy
- Short-term revenue pressures drive roadmap decisions without long-term fit
- Customer-specific asks dominate backlog over market-driven features

### No Ownership of Vision
- Vision statements are outdated or inconsistent across teams
- No accountable owner for product direction
- Leadership fails to reinforce vision in reviews and communications

### Unrealistic Promises
- Sales commitments made without product validation
- Roadmap items promised without delivery dates or resourcing
- Overlapping features with unclear ownership or purpose

### Weak Communication
- Roadmap not communicated to field teams or partners
- POV learnings not fed back into vision updates
- Customers unaware of direction and assume gaps in capability

## Mitigation Actions
- Maintain a single, consistent product vision statement
- Align roadmap to vision through quarterly governance reviews
- Document rationale for roadmap priorities and share with field teams
- Prohibit sales commitments outside approved roadmap
- Publish roadmap updates internally and externally on a predictable cadence

## Example
In a quarterly review, the roadmap included a feature that positioned BareCount as a visualization tool. The leadership flagged this as misaligned with the KPI-first vision. The feature was removed, and effort redirected toward schema registry improvements.

## Notes
Product vision and roadmap red flags should be reviewed bi-annually by leadership. Consistency is critical. A confused product narrative damages trust more than missing a feature.
