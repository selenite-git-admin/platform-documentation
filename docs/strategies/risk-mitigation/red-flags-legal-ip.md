# Legal and IP Red Flags

## Purpose
Identify risks related to legal terms and intellectual property (IP) during sales, contracting, and delivery of BareCount Data Action Platform. Addressing these red flags early prevents disputes, protects IP, and ensures sustainable relationships with enterprise customers.

## Context
Enterprise contracts often involve detailed legal reviews, procurement policies, and IP considerations. Customers may push for terms that conflict with BareCount’s business model or create long-term liabilities. Legal and IP risks must be managed carefully to avoid compromising ownership, confidentiality, or scalability.

## Common Red Flags

### IP Ownership Challenges
- Customer requests ownership of connectors or KPI packs built during POV
- Contract language implies joint IP without clear boundaries
- Requests to transfer source code or proprietary models

### Overreaching Liability Terms
- Indemnification clauses that go beyond BareCount’s control
- Unlimited liability demanded for indirect or consequential damages
- Expectations that BareCount guarantees customer data accuracy

### Contracting Complexity
- Customer insists on using non-standard contract templates
- Negotiations stall over minor legal points without business owner involvement
- Contract redlines introduce terms inconsistent with SaaS norms

### Confidentiality Risks
- Customer refuses to sign mutual NDA before discovery
- Requests for sensitive internal documentation beyond what is necessary
- Data sharing obligations that expose BareCount to compliance risk

## Mitigation Actions
- Standardize contract templates with approved legal language
- Protect IP by explicitly stating that connectors, KPI packs, and platform modules remain BareCount property
- Negotiate liability terms aligned with SaaS market practice
- Provide only required security and compliance documentation under NDA
- Escalate complex negotiations to legal counsel early

## Example
During a contract negotiation, a customer requested joint ownership of a finance KPI pack created during POV. BareCount flagged this as a red flag and clarified that all connectors and KPI packs are part of the core platform IP. The customer agreed once reassured that outcomes would still be delivered without IP transfer.

## Notes
Legal and IP red flags must be escalated immediately to leadership and legal counsel. No deal should close with unresolved IP ownership or liability issues. Protecting the platform’s IP ensures long-term scalability and defensibility.
