# Vendor and Partner Red Flags

## Purpose
Identify risks in vendor and partner relationships that may impact BareCount Data Action Platform. These red flags help ensure that external dependencies do not create delivery, credibility, or commercial issues.

## Context
BareCount engages with technology vendors, system integrators, and consulting partners to expand reach and deliver outcomes. While partnerships create scale, they also introduce risks such as misaligned incentives, weak delivery quality, or conflicts of interest. Proactive monitoring is required to maintain control.

## Common Red Flags

### Misaligned Incentives
- Partner prioritizes services revenue over platform subscription
- Vendor treats BareCount as a competitor rather than a complement
- Referral partners push deals without qualification to secure commission

### Weak Delivery Capability
- Partner lacks trained staff on BareCount platform
- High turnover in partner project teams
- Partner bypasses BareCount best practices during delivery

### Overdependence
- Single vendor controls critical infrastructure or integrations
- BareCount relies heavily on one partner for sales or delivery capacity
- Partner resists customer direct relationships, creating dependency

### Conflicts of Interest
- Partner simultaneously represents competitors
- Vendor promotes native tools over BareCount during joint pitches
- Misrepresentation of BareCount’s role in deals or marketing

### Commercial Risks
- Disputes over deal ownership between BareCount and partner
- Partners requesting margin structures that erode BareCount profitability
- Customer confusion over contracting entity in reseller arrangements

## Mitigation Actions
- Define clear partner agreements with roles, responsibilities, and incentives
- Certify partner delivery teams before assigning customer work
- Maintain direct executive relationships with customers even in partner deals
- Diversify vendor and partner ecosystem to avoid single points of failure
- Escalate conflicts of interest to leadership and resolve before customer impact

## Example
A regional partner attempted to deliver a BareCount POV without certification and failed to follow schema validation practices. KPI results were inaccurate, creating customer dissatisfaction. The incident was flagged, and BareCount introduced a partner certification program before further joint delivery.

## Notes
Vendor and partner red flags must be tracked in a dedicated register. Regular partner reviews should assess alignment, delivery quality, and conflicts. Strong governance over partnerships ensures BareCount’s brand and delivery standards remain intact.
