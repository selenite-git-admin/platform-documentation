# Product Development Red Flags

## Purpose
Identify risks that appear during product development and roadmap execution for BareCount Data Action Platform. These red flags help ensure that the platform evolves consistently with its vision and avoids being pulled into unsustainable directions.

## Context
BareCount is a product-first company. The platform’s value comes from reusable connectors, Golden Data Points, and KPI packs. When product development deviates into custom builds or poorly governed features, it creates technical debt, reduces focus, and dilutes the brand.

## Common Red Flags

### Customization Pressure
- Customer requests custom features during POVs or pilots
- Engineering time diverted into bespoke dashboards or reports
- Promises made in sales cycle that product team cannot support

### Roadmap Drift
- Prioritization driven by one large customer instead of market demand
- Features added without alignment to product vision
- Sudden changes in direction without documented rationale

### Weak Governance
- No formal backlog review or prioritization forum
- Features entering sprint without definition of done
- No validation from product leadership on new requests

### Technical Debt
- Quick fixes deployed without tests or documentation
- Core modules bypassed to deliver customer-specific shortcuts
- Growing backlog of bugs and tech debt not addressed

### Lack of Feedback Loops
- No structured process to capture customer feedback
- Engineering builds features without validation from field teams
- POV learnings not fed into roadmap planning

## Mitigation Actions
- Enforce product-first policy: POVs and implementations use standard platform features
- Document roadmap decisions with clear rationale and business case
- Establish backlog governance with product, engineering, and GTM leads
- Track and pay down technical debt in each release cycle
- Create structured channels for field teams to submit validated feedback

## Example
A customer requested a custom sales dashboard during a POV. Instead of diverting engineering time, the team positioned BareCount’s KPI packs as the solution. The request was logged as feedback, and later the roadmap team prioritized a generalized pipeline KPI pack that served multiple customers.

## Notes
Product development red flags must be logged in the risk tracker and reviewed during quarterly product reviews. Custom builds should be the exception, not the rule. Every deviation increases long-term risk.
