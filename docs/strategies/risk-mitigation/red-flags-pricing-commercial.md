# Pricing and Commercial Red Flags

## Purpose
Identify risks in pricing and commercial negotiations that can reduce margins, create delivery misalignment, or damage long-term positioning for BareCount Data Action Platform. Recognizing these risks helps maintain financial discipline and protect the subscription model.

## Context
BareCount is an enterprise subscription platform, not a one-time services project. Pricing conversations often expose customer expectations, negotiation styles, and risk appetite. Without guardrails, sales teams may be pressured into concessions that undermine sustainability.

## Common Red Flags

### Free or Unpaid Pilots
- Customer requests open-ended trial without payment
- Proof of value framed as “free demo” rather than scoped engagement
- Prospect refuses to define success criteria for pilot

### Heavy Discounting Pressure
- Early negotiation focuses on price, not value
- Customer compares BareCount pricing with SME tools like Tally or Zoho
- Requests for deep discounts before scope or KPIs are defined

### Misaligned Commercial Model
- Customer expects one-time project pricing rather than subscription
- Prospect insists on perpetual license or unlimited users without tiering
- Push for custom commercial terms outside standard contract

### Delayed Commitment
- Budget ownership unclear even after discovery
- Customer stalls by asking for “exploration” without timeline
- Decision deferred quarter after quarter despite fit and sponsorship

### Scope Without Budget
- Customer wants to add new systems or KPIs without adjusting contract
- Pricing challenges arise after scope has already expanded
- Prospect expects unlimited connectors for baseline subscription price

## Mitigation Actions
- Anchor pricing in subscription value, not feature lists
- Use pricing guardrails and avoid free pilots
- Reframe cost comparison against executive time saved or audit risks
- Escalate discount requests beyond agreed thresholds
- Require signed POV contracts with clear outcomes

## Example
During a sales cycle, a customer insisted on a free three-month pilot. The sales team flagged this as a red flag and repositioned the request as a scoped POV with defined outcomes. The customer agreed to a paid POV, leading to a successful subscription.

## Notes
Commercial red flags should be documented in CRM. Sales leadership should review all deals with discounting above thresholds. Guardrails protect both margin and brand positioning.
